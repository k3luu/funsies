Mount Islip is an amazing trail with plentiful opportunities for day hiking, backpacking, or thru-hiking parts of the PCT. This hike offers a more lush experience of the high San Gabriel Mountains combined with an exposed view of the Angeles Forest. Also, there's a hike-in campground called Little Jimmy, a popular site for thru hikers and a great base camp for tackling other peaks like Mt. Hawkins. The hike to Mount Islip begins at Islip Saddle,  a daunting 39.6 mile drive on the Angeles Crest Highway from La Ca√±ada Flintridge. Perfect for all you scenic drivers! There's a moderately sized parking lot located on the opposite side of the trailhead that typically fills up before noon. Don't forget to display your adventure pass and hit the Pacific Crest Trail.

The first mile takes you to the fire road, with a 630 ft elevation gain. For those eager to hit the trail, take it easy on the first mile if you're not used to the altitude. Once you cross the fire road, you will see a sign for Little Jimmy. From there it's another mile to the campgrounds.

While you hoof it up the incline you'll probably notice that the shrubbery along the trail is seemingly reaching towards you. One of the best experiences you can have while out here is not only touching the cusp of nature, but nature reaching back at you. Well, unless its poisonous, then you should probably go see a doctor.

Contrary to when you might think the above photos were taken, we actually set out on our hike in the late morning. Living in the cities of Southern California we can tell you that late morning gloom like this is somewhat of a rarity. Being out and about in the beautiful fog of Mt. Islip was truly refreshing. The contrast between the greenery and the sheath of fog is an easy wonder to overlook if you're too focused on the task at hand, so be sure that you're sneaking peeks as you brave the trail.

Once you hit Little Jimmy Campground, take a break and set up camp before you peak Mt. Islip. There's about 16 hike-in campsites, 2 vault toilets, fire rings, picnic benches, and water available from the springs.

It can get a bit confusing on where the trail starts up again, so make sure you pay attention to the stand alone signs. Keep west for the rock-marked trail for Little Jimmy Springs, and then stray right for Mt. Islip. Once you leave the campground it's 1.2 miles to the top. You got this.

It's a short distance to the top, so be sure to stay aware of your surroundings. We don't mean the aforementioned in a "Danger Will Robinson" kind of way, but more so in a way that begs you to take note of the landscape. Amongst the towering trees and lush overgrowth, you'll probably notice some pretty good fire damage that has accrued over the years. It's hard to put a positive spin on seeing damage like this, but as you look on in dread or whatever you might feel, just try to remind yourself that everything has a natural cycle.

As the trail begins to wrap around the summit, you'll find an old stone cabin on the north side. When you reach the peak, be sure to sign and date the Visitor Log inside the ammunition box. Take some time to absorb the views, eat snacks, and talk among your travel companions. As you sit around panting, check out the cabin that serves as a reminder that the very space in which you impose yourself was made for you by nature. Day to day life makes it hard to appreciate where you're placed in the world. Most people probably spend 90% of their life walked on paved sidewalks and manmade flooring, and in return we forget how powerful the connection to the world can be when surrounded by its natural glory. Whether you make it out here alone, or with companions, these moments in which you are allowed to experience the purity of nature should be appreciated to the fullest. Take notice.

The photos in this post were taken in early Spring, but still have the markings of a grueling winter. Rain, hail, snow, and below freezing temperatures sum up our trip, but nonetheless, makes it on our list of snowy, all-time favorite adventures. Here's the view on a clear, sunny day. In any case, you're in for some rewarding work, and some awe-inspiring moments.
