Without waver, his strong passion for the outdoors inevitably led to protecting it.',

      'Los Angeles-based photographer, Robert, is susceptible to elevation sickness. Why does he continue to explore the Great Outdoors? Because he loves it.',
      'Having been with the Boy Scouts of America since 6 years old, he learned the fundamentals of exploring and surviving in the wilderness. He continues to expand his knowledge about exploration and applies them to every adventure he pursues.',
      'Robert has put his focus on photographing nature and his adventures shared with friends and family. He shoulders the extra weight on each expedition to document their stories and relive their experiences for all time.

    bio: [
      'Colt is a writer and scholar currently teaching in the Sonoma County area and has been “playing with rocks” his entire life. Although his education is seemingly unrelated to the world around him, he often pulls creative inspiration from his surroundings. 2010 served as a critical juncture in Colt’s life, as he discovered the strong ties between man and nature were of the utmost importance to creativity; which is why he relocated from Los Angeles to Sonoma County.',
      'Drawing much of his inspiration from nature for his creative thesis at Sonoma State University, Colt feels that many people miss out on what surrounds them on a daily basis. Being a part of Two Half-Hitches gives him the opportunity to work with like-minded people and educate those who may be curious to get back into the wild.',
      'Colt serves as the senior editor. His ultimate goal is to re-enchant those who have become jaded towards the outdoors by communicating our values in a more poetic way to a wider audience. Although he is out with a serious knee injury, we hope to have him exploring with Two Half-Hitches again soon.'
