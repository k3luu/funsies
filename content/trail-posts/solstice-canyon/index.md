The serenity of Solstice Canyon can be found in the Santa Monica Mountains, less than a mile away from the beaches of Malibu on Corral Canyon Road. This hike is characterized by remains of a burned down mansion, one of the only year-round waterfalls in the Santa Monica Mountains, as well as scenic views of the canyon and ocean. Historically, Solstice was a pioneer of space research by Thompson-Ramo-Woolridge (TRW) as early as the 1960s, and originally used to test satellite equipment for space missions. Named after the company, the TRW trail now takes you through the heights of the Rising Sun Trail and deeper into Solstice Canyon.

Begin your hike after you've braved the heavily-trafficked parking lot that is the bane of every adventurers existence. The trail itself is quite popular in the South Bay, which means serenity and solitude are out the window for a while before you distance yourself from the pack. The Forest Service manages the trail, and you can see the level of work they do, as the trail is in great condition. We recommend you take the Rising Sun Trail first to hit all the great views before you descend into the canyon. The first quarter mile is entirely paved, which serves as a very polite warm-up before you start making your way up the dirt trail. Take this route if you're looking for a more strenuous and rugged experience, because the landscape panorama and ocean glimpse is worth all the sweat.

We'd have to fact check this, but we're pretty sure we went on what have might have been the hottest day in 2016. Note: the Rising Sun Trail has pretty much zero shade, so wear a hat, put on some sunscreen, and bring at least a liter of water.

After about 2 miles, the trail begins to descend into the canyon and you will soon be graced with a kind kiss of shade. Continue down the staircase, and you will reach a sign.

Take a breather, and explore around the area. There are some old ruins of a mansion constructed in 1952, but succumbed to a fire in 1982. Granted that the loss of a piece of history is always a tragedy, there is still some fun to be had rifling through a tangible look into the past. Make sure you take an imaginary dip in the claw-foot bathtub in the middle of the concrete slab. At this point, you'll probably feel like you need the mental rejuvenation.

Make sure that if you stop to take pictures, or explore the ruins, that you mind the sun. It's easy to become swept up in this adult playground, but try to grab a hold of your inner-child and remind them that dehydration and sunburns are cruel realities of the outdoor life.

After you're done taking semi-offensive pictures with your buddies go ahead over to the waterfall. Unfortunately, the falls were not as awe-inspiring as they could be on a better, less Hell-like day. Nonetheless, it would behove you to take a breath and drink in your surroundings.

Sure, the Rising Sun Trail is a good amount of physical effort, but we're pretty sure that the contrasting views of ocean and canyon will be enough to make you forget about your cramping legs. Stick together, pace yourself, don't be afraid to explore, but stay hydrated.

Few places in the world inspire on multiple levels. Solstice Canyon is full of many beautiful rarities that are capable of inspiring all kinds of people. From tangible glimpses of past man's ambition that is still seemingly smoldering, to the first breath of sea breezes that greet you while ascending to the cusp of the canyon; there exist a wealth of discovery and wonder within the canyon. Go find what's missing.
