###Is Backountry water safe to drink?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water in the outdoors is exposed to both wildlife and humans. As the outdoors become more heavily trafficked with explorers, the quality of water decreases. Crystal clear sources may look safe, but can carry dangerous viruses and other bacteria detrimental to your health.

###What water sources are available?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depending on where you are going, access to water sources may be limited. Research your destination and check for seasonal streams, access to water spigots, snow, etc.

###Why should I use purification tablets?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iodine tablets are able to decontaminate water with viruses and bacteria that are too small for water filters.

###Where should I get my water from?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrieve your water from clear and free flowing sources. Make sure to check upstream and avoid collecting downstream of camping areas, areas where mining has occurred, and agricultural areas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avoid getting water from stagnant sources if possible, such as lakes and ponds. Standing water is more prone to increased levels of waterborne viruses, sediments, and other bacteria.

###More water treatment tips

- Separate clean and dirty water containers to avoid cross-contamination.
- Pay attention to manufacturer instructions. Treatment is less effective if tablets do not reside in the water for the specified period of time.
- Keep camp, toilet, and dishwashing areas of your camp at a minimum of 100-200 feet from your water source.
- Untouched snow and ice are typically clean and ready to drink. Do not eat ice or snow as it will lower your body temperature.
