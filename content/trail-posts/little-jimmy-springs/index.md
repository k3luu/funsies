&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Jimmy Springs can be found just a few yards away from Little Jimmy Trail Camp; a haven for thru hikers braving the Pacific Crest Trail. Standing at 7,500 ft in elevation, this hike takes you through the lush backcountry of the northern parts of the Angeles National Forest and is unbelievably scenic and calming. You can take a drink from the springs (treat before consuming) or break for lunch at the campsites. Though a short hike, this can be paired with a summit to Mount Islip making this a 6 mile out and back trail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Route yourself to Islip Saddle, which can be found via Google Maps. The drive can be a bit daunting, as the trail head is much deeper into the forest, but it can be enjoyable if you're used to carving through the mountains. If you're heading northbound on the Angeles Crest Highway, the parking lot can be found on your left after you pass two tunnels. We began our hike at 8 in the morning and found a few cars parked before us. Display an adventure pass, walk across the highway, and head up the incline to the PCT marker.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first mile on the PCT can be heart pounding for some, but try to let the beautiful scenery take your mind off of it. The elevation is much higher in these areas, so you might find yourself short of breath from the start. Below you'll see a spot with a wide view of whats to come on this trail. The fashionable mountain ahead looks like its been acid washed and studded with green. Normally we talk about the color green as a singular color way, but on this hike we were treated to a myriad of shades. From pale green, to almost Crayola neon green, the spectrum shines on all fronts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a mile of straight elevation gain, you will come across a fire access road and small trail marker for the destinations up ahead. Take a breather, because the next mile to the camp is completely leveled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another great part about this trail is that dogs are welcomed!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately we've been mixing work with passion, and that tends to bring out our inner children. For instance, sure, we know not to climb tree limbs, but the tree limbs pictured below look like the monkey bars we used to swing on when we were young. There's a dichotomy to nature that is in deep conflict. Most of these trees have been giants since before many of us were born, and somehow they still impress upon us a sense of youthfulness. Even the bright green that sweeps out into the sky in the second picture below has a playful vibe to it. Of course, we wouldn't be doing anyone a service if we failed to muse on our four legged companion in the third picture below who looks to be in their element on the trail. Always happy to have a canine companion out on the trail with us!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Jimmy Trail Camp has 16 hike-in campsites on a first come, first serve basis. There is easy access to the springs, and makes a great beginner trip for those interested in overnighters and beyond. There are two toilets, a few benches, tables, and stoves, for those who are not into the ruggedness of the outdoors. Once you've admired how "luxurious" the campsite is, continue onto the trail northeast bound and you will hit a sign for Little Jimmy Springs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail to the left takes you to the springs, while the trail on the right takes you to Mt. Islip. If you decide you want to hit the peak after checking out the springs, the trail will join with the ascent to the peak, so don't worry about having to backtrack.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk a couple of yards past the sign and the spring will be right around the corner. There are a few tree stumps and makeshift benches. Relax and unwind, and take a drink of the springs. According to reviews and other blogs out there, many hikers have been observed drinking directly from the springs without any form of treatment. We don't know what happens to them after, but we encourage treating backcountry water no matter the circumstances. You know, just to prevent a zombie apocalypse and things of that nature. When everything is said and done this trail is a worthwhile trip, hands down.
