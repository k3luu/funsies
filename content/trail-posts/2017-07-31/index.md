Measuring 3.5 miles out and back, and with only 375 feet of elevation gain, Eaton Canyon Falls might just be Los Angeles' most popular hiking trail. Located above the City of Pasadena, this hike takes you through a scenic canyon and ends with a 40-foot (somewhat nice) waterfall - the epitome of rewards for Southern California hikers. If you enjoy company, this is the trail for you. BEWARE! Eaton Canyon is heavily-trafficked! For those who prefer a more private experience on the trail, we recommend you take a look at some of our previous posts to find a trail better suited for a more solitary hike.

The trail starts at the Eaton Canyon Natural Area Park and Nature Center. An Adventure Pass is not required and there are no parking fees. Please note that the parking lot is for day-use only, and if you are planning an overnighter at Henninger Flats, this is not the place to park. Dogs are allowed, but must be leashed, and the parking lot closes at dusk.

The first half-mile follows a dirt access road lined with dense vegetation and brush, with absolutely no shade. Bring at least a liter of water and a hat. It's going to get hot out there, and it would be a shame if someone had to turn back before getting to that rewarding waterfall.

Take notice of Eaton Wash to your left, which may be a dried creek bed depending what season you decide to hit this trail. As you can see in the first photo below, the creek was bone dry when we set out. Even though the implications of a dry creek can be a downer, seeing the stones that spatter the length of the creek bed is an interesting experience. If you're a "dreamer", or "thinker," type this is a good spot to reflect on how everything in nature has its place. As we stated in the beginning of our post, this is a heavily trafficked trail, which is evident in both the first and second photos below. Personally, we like to focus on the scenery, rather than the amount of people, because this is the place we've all come to escape. With the previous statement in the open, if you're a "people watching" person, this could be an entertaining hike for you on several different levels. Whatever gets you out there!

At approximately 1 mile you will hit a junction and the trail will split. You can either head right towards Mount Wilson Toll Road, which takes you up to Henninger Flats or stay left to continue onto Eaton Canyon Falls. Pass under the bridge where your adventure into the canyon begins. While this next little bit may sound pretentious, we thought it was worth pointing out that this bridge seems both invasive and expected at the same time. We can see our assertion on our surroundings heavily on this trail in both positive and negative ways. Probably the best part about canyon hiking is that the trail is always shaded no matter the time of day. As you can see in the photos below, many people come to observe the falls. We can't say the amount of people doesn't make sense because, well, it makes complete sense in terms of the escapism the falls create. Staring through plate glass windows at asphalt and concrete all day is a drag, and the falls create a perfect sense of communal separation from the "city life."

You will have to cross a few smalls creeks here and there, but nothing to worry about. As you walk through the canyon, you get this intense feeling of being sucked into something much greater than yourself. While we can't pinpoint the feeling, the closest thing to it would be the "pull of the void" sensation when staring over the edge of a high place. Jaw dropping, and memorable, the canyon alluringly stands above you, blocking the sun from entering.

After another mile, you will hear a swarm of people, laying about and enjoying the falls. Kick off your boots (if you prefer) and take a dip in the small pool.

Our first time at Eaton Canyon Falls was 7 years ago, where hiking and adventuring meant something a little different. Many of the popular hiking trails were once vacant, lightly-trafficked, and in pristine condition. As much as we advocate for hiking and all things outdoors, we would like to stress the importance of outdoor etiquette. It is all of our responsibility to keep these places clean, so that future generations may enjoy it as we once did. Pack out what you pack in.
