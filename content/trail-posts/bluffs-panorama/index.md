&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need a little break from the forest? Head over to Big Sur State Park, a rugged stretch of California's central coast between San Simeon to the south and Carmel to the north. A very popular state park, Big Sur offers luxurious resorts, RV campsites, and your typical car camping, on the bluffs or streamside. Either way, you're going to get that breathtaking ocean view.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several camp sites that span across Big Sur. Among the many popular are Andrew Molera State Park, Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, Kirk Creek Campground, Limekiln State Park, and of course, Point Lobos. If you decide not to make reservations, there are always the first-come, first-serve camp sites.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stayed at Andrew Molera State Park, a beautiful, undeveloped land that offers several hiking trails and endless beachcombing.  There's a fee of $10 per car, per day and an additional $25 camping fee per night. If you decide to stay, there's also a one-third mile hike from the parking lot to about 24 walk-in campsites.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you set up camp and settle in, it's time to hit the trails. The hiking varies from meadows and beaches, to hilltops, forest thickets, and even crossing small estuaries. We recommend you bring wind wear, as it does get extremely windy. And of course, your summer bathing suit you've been waiting to throw on!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are plenty of places to take a break, set up a picnic, and just lounge around. Now there's a secret spot along the Bluff trail, a hidden gem, if you will. If you can find it, kudos to you!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from Andrew Molera, there's Point Lobos and Pfeiffer beach. Both very touristy places, but nonetheless, offer great hiking trails and scenery of wildlife.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Sur is a perfect visit for the Spring and Summer seasons. A nice change from the typical pine forests. But no matter where you go, you'll develop an appreciation and understanding of how powerful, yet vulnerable the ocean can be.
