The hike to the Big Pine Lakes is a powerful and humbling experience that sees you traverse the alpine terrain of the High Sierra Mountains and gain nearly 3,000 ft in elevation. This moderately-trafficked hike takes you through a 14-mile loop to seven former glaciers, the Palisades, which can now be seen as basins that make up these lakes. This is a challenge worth the reward with opportunities for side destinations and extensions between lakes. The dramatic landscape and calm waters will make anyone, seasoned or beginner hikers, pause for careful observation. Hiking boots are recommended for this hike.

The hike begins at Big Pine Creek Campground, approximately 45 minutes west of the City of Big Pine. Head down Crocker Street from the 395 highway until the road terminates. There is a parking lot available at the trailhead and overflow parking lot adjacent to the bridge from the campgrounds. The trail continues past the access gate shown below.

We hiked this trail in late Fall, and the waters were raging from a fruitful winter. You will come across a wooden bridge, although man-made, blends effortlessly with the lush greenery.

The various terrains that make up this hike can be seen at nearly the beginning of the hike. A magnificent and exposed valley full of arid shrubbery, pine trees, and craggy summits all tied under an ominous sky.

The text provided on the trail signage is consistent throughout the hike. The first sign will come up at the quarter-mile mark. You are either heading up the North Fork Trail or down the South Fork Trail. Stay north all the way through.

The trail gains in elevation rather quickly, with steep switchbacks until you reach a meadow reminiscent of those found in Yosemite and in some parts of the Sequoias.

One of our favorite parts of this hike was the segment through the valley. The scenery demands your attention. Evergreens nestled between mountains, it almost seems like youâ€™ve found the hidden gem of the Inyo National Forest. **The trail becomes much more technical at this point.**

At the 2 mile marker, the John Muir Wilderness sign will greet you. The way it protrudes out onto the trail almost seems like itâ€™s giving you a high-five for surviving the loosely-graveled switchbacks.

Immediately following the sign, the color of the surrounding rocks change to resemble that of the red rocks found in the Grand Canyon. You will find yourself hiking parallel with the creek into the lush forest. The terrain and scenery change drastically over the next 3 miles.

The image below was one of our favorites. It reminded us of the terrain you would typically find in the Pacific Northwest â€” Evergreen pines precariously balanced on rock formations. A chaotic, yet beautiful stage.

Depending on the weather conditions, Temple Crag can be seen at several segments throughout the trail.

At the 4 mile marker, the trail will split once more. Continue west towards the seven lakes.

The first of the seven Big Pine Lakes will appear almost out of nowhere. As you look up towards the trail, the water will glitter through the cracks of the rocks until you come up to this vast basin.

The second lake is located 0.1 miles from the first lake and is arguably more picturesque. Temple Crag, known for crag climbing, stands fiercely in the distance. Razor-like rocks formed from glaciated granite splits the sky with glacial erratics scattered around the lake. Of all the places weâ€™ve hiked, this massive granite cathedral is one of the most stunning sights we have ever seen. After youâ€™ve engraved this view in your mind, head back the way you came or continue on the loop to the remaining lakes.
