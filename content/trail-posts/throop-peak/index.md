Throop peak makes it on our top list for one of the best day hikes in Southern California!
This trail offers a 360 degree panoramic view of the San Gabriel mountains. The more notable
features of the trail include being filled with conifers, vast clearings and wildflowers
studded about the scenery. Located near Valyermo, California, this trail is a 4 mile, out
and back, lightly-trafficked hike through the northern area of the Angeles National Forest.
Throop Peak is rated as an easy to moderate hike, with roughly 1,200 ft of elevation gain within
2 miles. For those conditioned for hiking, this trek may just be a walk in the park. Trail
conditions are best from early March to late November, and may be possible during the winter.
Dogs are welcome, but must be leashed.

The trail begins at Dawson Saddle (searchable on Google Maps), located near a very subtle
trail marker (pictured below). There are 2 ways to get to the trailhead. From the 210, exit
La Canada Flintridge and take the Angeles Crest Highway northeast for about 45 miles. From
Wrightwood, travel westbound on the Angeles Crest Highway for approximately 15 miles. You
will pass by a sign up on the ridge that reads "Dawson Saddle." Park at the turnout, hang
up an Adventure Pass, and walk a few yards eastbound to what will be your first switchback.

Throop Peak offers a healthy range of scenery. You will find yourself walking through
heavily shaded areas, vast clearings, overgrown shrubbery, and rocks that seem to guide
you on your journey to the top. If you are lucky enough, you might find patches of snow
along the trail in the Spring. As you begin your hike, you will notice a few switchbacks
with sharp inclines. Do not worry, this will only persist for about a half-mile. From there,
the rest of the trail is quite gentle and forgiving. We wanted to take a break from our usual
backpacking adventures, and instead, relax on a nice day hike with just a simple day pack.
As pictured below, we took notice of the way the trees seem to puncture that beautiful
blue sky. Oddly enough, we weren't just impressed by the trees, even some of the
shrubbery was cause for pause. The shrubbery seems to drip down the mountain side,
framing the bottom half of the gorgeous clearing below. We definitely recommend taking
your time on this one, even though it can be a quick out and back type of deal.

Dawson Saddle Trail was built by Boy Scout volunteers in 1982
(for an Eagle Project perhaps). Fun Fact #1: Franz built a trail for his Eagle Project
back in 2010, but was nowhere near as amazing and well-defined as this one. Thank you
Boy Scouts of America, you guys did a fantastic job!

The trail continues to meander, partially shaded and
accompanied by brief moments
to take a peak at Mt. Baden-Powell to the east. Fun Fact #2: Mount Baden-Powell was
named after the founder and first Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America. Being raised
predominantly in cities, we often find ourselves constantly impressed by the views we are
surrounded by at any given moment. If there is one highlight to the photos below, it would
have to be that we aren't breaking our necks to look up at the sky. Rather, the view we've
been looking up at our whole lives is simply surrounding us at every juncture throughout
the trail. While the same can be said for a great many of trails, we would be remiss if we
didn't bask in our surroundings on these day trips. If you're like us, then you're probably
bummed out that there aren't many man made adult playgrounds. Well, have no fear, nature
provides us with plenty of rocks and fallen trees to fill in for our childhood favorite
jungle gyms. Down below you can also see us waver a bit in the snow, unlike the trees in
front of us, which seem to be at attention 24/7.

Continue heading south along the north ridge of
Throop Peak for about 1.5 miles until you hit the PCT marker. From here, you can
either head northeast towards Mt. Baden-Powell, or head southwest towards Throop Peak.
You may find backpackers on this trail heading towards Little Jimmy Campground, a haven
for those braving the PCT. Say hello and point them in the right direction. You can
either make this hike more challenging by hiking south towards Mt. Hawkins, or turn
it into an overnighter at Little Jimmy. Either way, while you're slogging through the
trail, remember to keep your head up to make sure you don't miss out on the views.
Truthfully though, nature will find a way, as you may notice your feet getting lost in
the fields that enclose the trail itself. Go ahead and take this as nature reminding
you to look up and take a healthy dose of beauty in as you continue on.

DON'T MISS THIS! In approximately 100 feet after
passing the PCT marker, the trail will subtly fork. It was so subtle we actually missed
it and had to backtrack a bit. The PCT will be on your left, and the day use route to
Throop Peak will be on your right. It may be marked with a pile of stones (called a "cairn").

As you make your way to the peak, you will
notice the gradual elevation gain. Persevere! Unfortunately, we did not see any
wildflowers blooming near the summit; however, a better reward is in store. What
looks like another clearing will actually be the peak. Power through the remaining
switchbacks and you're there! Have a seat and take a moment to appreciate the plaque
honoring Amos Throop, the founder of Throop University, now known as the California
Institute of Technology. Standing at 9,138 ft, Throop Peak provides a 360 view of Mt.
Baden-Powell, the Devils Punchbowl, Antelope Valley, and even Mt. Baldy if you look
hard enough.

Although this hike was a mere 4 miles out and
back, we took several breaks, not because we were too tired to move, but simply to
enjoy our surroundings and each other's company. We knew we were going to hit the peak,
and so we took our time. We are all very focused on getting from point A to point B, but
forget what makes it an adventure. The breathtaking views, the pleasant conversations, and
all those moments that move us. It's all about the everything in between. Getting caught
up in life is unavoidable, but we've found the easiest way to combat the rat-race is to
keep trying new things. Sure, we do a lot of backpacking, but nothing beats a day hike at
the end of a stressful work week. Remember, keep your head up, eyes open, and drink it all
in. There's no rush here.
