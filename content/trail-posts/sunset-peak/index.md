&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunset Peak offers one of the most spectacular views in the Mt. Baldy bowl. What's the catch? It's a lightly-trafficked, 8 mile out and back hike up a bland, windy fire access road. Don't worry, as this blog will show you two ways to make it to the top. You can either take the "safe" and leisurely dirt road, or the more challenging and adventurous route up the ridge of the mountain (pictured below). The level of thrill will be up to you, but either path will give you glimpses of the beautiful Cucamonga Wilderness, the majestic Mt. Baldy, and the seemingly-endless San Antonio Canyon as the trail spirals to the peak.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail is located at the border of the San Gabriel Mountains and the Cucamonga Wilderness. The great part about the hike is that the drive to the trail head is short, whereas many of the hikes in the Angeles National Forest require logging in 20+ miles on the Angeles Crest Highway. Start by exiting Base Line Road off of the 210 Freeway. Turn onto Mills Road, and then make a right when you hit Mt Baldy Road. From there, head northbound until you hit Glendora Ridge Road. You will eventually hit a gravel packed lot and a forest service gate. Get those boots on, and hit the the ground running!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to take the fire road up the mountain. It's a good area for getting acclimated, warming up those legs, and catching up with new and old friends. The Forest Service road runs along the north side of the mountain and is heavily shrouded in trees. The tree line is so prominent that much of this segment will be shaded. The elevation gain is gradual, consistent, and almost unnoticeable. The trail is well maintained, and the terrain is nothing to fear, even if all you have is running shoes. If you decide to head up the spine of the mountain, you're up for a whole new hiking experience. Hiking boots are recommended for the ridge route as the ascension is steep and filled with loose gravel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The San Gabriel mountains are always a treat, and never fail to inspire us. No matter which direction you are heading, the 360 views cannot be beat. Depending on the time of day, you may find yourself at eye level with the clouds. We started our hike around 8AM, and the clouds came to greet us. Truly an ethereal experience, walking atop the clouds that hover over the valley is an immensely humbling, and a unique experience. However, these unique experiences, as we often express, are best when shared with friends, family, or even new friends you've picked up along the trail. Looking out over the clouds and sharing ideas with other like-minded individuals guarantees moments you'll fail to forget.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you hit the halfway mark, you will find a remarkable clearing with a sharp curve that sends you back in the direction you came. Look for an arrow on the ground to point you in the right direction. Catch your breath and take some time to admire the views you may have been missing out on throughout the hike. As you can see below, the trail widens and gives way to lush greenery. One thing we noticed is the contrast between the taupe colored trail etched out by man, and the green rolling tides of vegetation that never fail to reach down towards you as you take a moment to realize the full gravity of where your boots are planted. It's always entertaining to think on what the trail would be like without maintenance. The third photo below sees the vegetation is reaching out across the trail to meet its kin on the other side, or maybe we're just daydreaming. Either way, take a minute and do some dreaming.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a quarter mile after hitting the bend, you will notice the ridge of the mountain and the vast beauty that is the San Antonio Canyon and Mt Baldy Bowl. Honestly, this view seems like a rarity coming from LA county, but as we've come to notice, there are so many of these gorgeous views throughout Southern California, each with their own unique characteristics that drop our jaws every time. However, this is the point where the ridge trail intersects with the fire road. If you decided not to walk across the spine of the mountain, you can always take it back down. As you turn and make your way, you will notice a subtle fork in the trail. Stay right to continue on the fire road, or stray slightly left and brace yourself for some intense elevation gain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hike offers two opportunities to take on the ridge route if you're feeling a bit more adventurous. The ridge is considered a shortcut, not in time, but in distance. Pace yourself as you make your ascension, you'll be needing the energy. In about a quarter mile, you will come across a few boulder faces. Be careful as you climb, watch your footing, and get on up there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And here we are! Nothing like a group selfie to celebrate a successful and safe hike to the top. If you time it perfectly, the clouds will not only greet you at the trail head, but maybe decide to hit the trail with you. After about 10 minutes of relaxation, our 360 view was whited out.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you breathe in the fresh mountain air, return the way you came. The ridge trail back is filled with dense vegetation and spotted pine trees. Do some exploring on your own, or with friends. This is the perfect time to check everything out. Even the smallest flower can be foreign. Don't sell this view short in your head. Your feet dipped in clouds and mist nipping at your heel. As you look across from where you stand, it becomes easy to see yourself on any of the mountain tops that are presenting themselves. A humbling and resonant experience that is sure to touch some of you out there, and if you don't have the nature bug just yet, you might after this hike specifically.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as we return to the San Gabriel Mountains for a weekend getaway, the awe-inspring views never cease to amaze us. So here we are at the end of our hike, and the end of our post. You may have seen it coming, but here's the big take-away. Challenges are always going to be strenuous, such is the nature of a challenge. However, when you have people to lean on, and vice versa, the challenge becomes something to savor, as it is actively bettering you and bonding you with the people you have chosen to surround yourself with on the journey. No matter the number of those around you, be it one, or seven, there will always be a shared connection through physical struggle and traveling with like-minded people. So goes the journey, so goes life.
