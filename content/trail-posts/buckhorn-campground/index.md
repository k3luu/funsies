Buckhorn Campground is arguably the most popular drive-in campground in the Angeles National Forest. The campgrounds are well-maintained by the Forest Service, and the serene views are straight out of an outdoor magazine. The sites are mostly shaded by both pine and redwood-like trees, and the vegetation that ties it all in gives it an oasis feeling. Granted the oasis is pretty packed depending on the time of year, and especially on holidays. During the day, you can also hike to <a href="/cooper-canyon-falls">Cooper Canyon Falls</a> along the Burkhart Trail, or wander on the Pacific Crest Trail and Silver Moccasin Trail for some day hiking! Buckhorn is a great place for those who have trouble sitting still, as there are a good deal of options when it comes to daytime adventures.
