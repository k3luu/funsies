###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sturtevant Falls may be the epitome of Angeles hikers looking for simple, yet rewarding hikes.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This 3.1 mile, out and back, heavily-trafficked hike takes you
through lush greenery, ivy-covered cabins, and ends with a trickling waterfall.
This hike is best during the winter and spring months when the creeks are really flowing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Route yourself to Chantry Flats, which is about 15-20 minutes away after exiting
the 210 freeway. This is one of the most popular hikes in Los Angeles, so it's best
to get here as early as possible. We decided to hit this trail on a Friday around 7
in the morning and lucked out with only a few cars in the parking lot. Although
there are two parking lots (upper and lower), cars will begin to park on the side
of the highway. Display an Adventure Pass, and make your way past the gates shown
below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hike begins on a paved road for about a half mile and aggressively descends
into the canyon. You will come across this sign (pictured below) which you may
have seen many times on social media. While the saying on the sign itself may
seem a bit cliché, we'd like to remind you that clichés were born from something
so original, so true, that people have taken them and overused them when no other
words will do the job. Thus, this sign stands as a reminder of a simple truth that
we all forget in our day to day lives. Please do everyone a favor, and leave your
artwork elsewhere. Fortunately, it looks like the U.S. Forest Service did some
maintenance on this trail and removed all the graffiti from the signs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third photo below is where the trail splits off. Hermit Falls serves as one of
the other popular hikes in the area, which is known for it's prime cliff jumping
environment back in the day. We're not sure if cliff jumping is still allowed, but
nonetheless, Hermit Falls is another short and rewarding hike.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Located in the most southern part of the Angeles Forest, you won't be seeing any
pine trees here, rather dense shrubbery as far as the eye can see. Don't cry over
the lack of trees just yet, as you'll be treated to some gorgeous wide shots of all
that surrounds you. The photo below is one of our favorites we've snagged so far.
Amongst the drapery of flowing shrubs we spotted some of the most perfect lighting
we've ever seen on the trail. Centered among it's peers, the peak in the distance
is crowned in golden light; a reminder that we walk in the shadow of majesty.
Although the picture is one of our favorites, it still doesn't do this view justice.
You'll just have to get out there and see for yourself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue pass the bridge and follow signs for the Gabrielino Trail. The trail is
mostly shaded and there is little to no elevation gain. Bridges are always
conversation pieces to us, mainly because they serve as a means to connect
two things that are separated. Heading out on these trails is our own way of
building a bridge back to nature, back to something simpler.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time you will be following the creek towards the falls, while cascading
dams (shown below) and several creek crossings mark the path. The vegetation is
lush and the sound of flowing water makes this a very calming hike. You can see
in the second photo below how dense the ivy can get as it swarms everything it
touches. You can even see the ivy dripping from the largest limb that presides over
the trail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another famous photo you will come across is the one down below. This one really
speaks to us, and may be the reason why Two Half-Hitches even exists. Either way,
we hope it speaks to you too. If these signs don't inspire, the trail is surely
capable of doing so on its own.

![alt_text](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Sturtevant+Falls/Content/_J8A4893.jpg "three")

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough, you will come across some quiet cabins fully intact. You
won't see the residents, but all cabins are private property so please be respectful.
They also remind us of The Shire, and the sign for Fiddler's Crossing just sounds
like something out of LOTR. Even though these cabins are man's mark on nature,
there's something about them that seem to fit right in among the vast green
curtains that surround the cabins. Surrounded by a moat of ivy, these cabins
are a point of interest for our team, as we wish we could spend all day swimming
through our fantasies of living here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiddler's Crossing will be the 1.5 mile mark. The stream crossings can be a bit
difficult depending on how much flow is coming from the falls, especially for
those wearing running shoes. Below you'll see the natural path, half-paved with
slippery stones. The rocks can also be slippery, so watch your step. The photo
below is a great example of the vast variety California has to offer. Surely this
is not the California we see daily, but it is out there if you choose to get on the
trail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the vegetation begins to draw near, this is the indication that you
are nearly at your end destination. Your prize is right around the corner, but
take time to appreciate the tunnel of leaves you're about to travel through. It
may seem small, but these little things are where the beauty exists.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now behold, a 50-ft waterfall trickling down the face of a rock formation into
a shallow pool. Not the grandest of falls, but still relaxing nonetheless.
Unfortunately, this winter season hasn't been the greatest and evidence of
that can be seen in the photos below. During the summer months, many people
dunk themselves in the water and stand at the foot of the falls. Even though
there may not seem to be a lot going on, the sheer size of it all is enough to
give us pause. We pale in comparison to the size of this weeping stone face. Go
ahead and chalk this up to your rare humbling experience. Simply standing at
the shallow pool, we feel something that is beyond our words. Maybe that cliché
sign at the beginning has something to it. You should go find out.
