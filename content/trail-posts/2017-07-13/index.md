&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Located in Southern California, the Palos Verdes Peninsula exhibits quite extraordinary geography. A city characterized by bluffs and vast hillside landscaping that abruptly stops at the coast with some areas that seem to protrude into the Pacific Ocean. The peninsula is also home to the Portuguese Bend, a 399-acre nature park where the ocean is seemingly-endless and Catalina Island appears to be within arms reach. The reserve is filled with coastal sage scrub and serves as habitat for migrating birds on the Pacific Flyway during the fall and spring. With temperatures in the high 80s, we decided to avert our eyes from the mountains to the north and head south towards the coast.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portuguese Bend Reserve trail head can be found at Del Cerro Park at the end of Crenshaw Boulevard. The lot at the park is limited, and street parking can be extremely difficult. Get there early and you should have no problem. After taking some time to appreciate the views, make your way down the asphalt road to an access gate - your nature walk will begin here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Del Cerro Park, take the Burma Road trail and descend into the reserve. Just remember to save some energy for going back uphill. The Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy constantly maintains the trail, and they do a terrific job, as this trail is heavily-trafficked by locals. They also run a volunteer program, which provides a great opportunity to give back to the community and learn more about the natural area. These types of programs are great for those who are looking for a different type of volunteer experience that can be directly felt when walking the trail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portuguese Bend is made up of a network of trails that span the entire reserve. You decide where to go, how far, and the difficulty. We decided to cut through the Peacock Flats Trail, which is a quarter mile shortcut that puts you back on the Burma Road Trail. In the photos below you'll see more shades of brown, rather than green. While at first these photos may seem less vibrant than some of the other shots we've captured on the blog, the contrast becomes more enamoring in person. While fields of tans and browns control the landscape, we loved noticing the defiant greens that thrive here and there.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the hike, we found a few of these little guys we believe were cicadas (or at least they sound like them).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After another quarter mile past Peacock Flats Trail, you will hit the Kelvin Canyon Trail.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Kelvin Canyon Trail, you can either take the first left onto Gary's Gulch Trail towards the coast or head north on Rattlesnake Trail. We decided to go with Rattlesnake Trail, which we found has one of the steepest elevation gains. If you get a little too deep over your head, don't worry, you always have the option to cut it short. However, we always encourage people to push themselves if they feel comfortable and safe. No shame in taking it slow, or saving the steeper trail for another day. It's good to know your limits, but equally as important to safely push your boundaries and expectations of yourself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's no secret that Palos Verdes is an especially geologically unstable part of Southern California, and the Portuguese Bend area is no exception to the rule. With a long history of landslides, as well as other phenomenons, the area is said to be heavily researched by scientists. The 1950s saw the first of the modern landslides to affect homeowners living in the Portuguese Bend area. Caused by slippage and erosion, as well as other theorized causes, these landslides are no joke, especially to those in the community. This area is definitely temperamental, and it shows in the scars left behind by the mass wasting. We don't mean to spook people, but we do think that knowing a little bit about the area in which you're traveling is a good thing at any rate. Geology nuts are sure to love this trail, but there is plenty more to love about the area.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the best part about this hike for us? It's in our "backyard." All members of the Two Half-Hitches Team were born and raised in what we call the South Bay, where the Palos Verdes Peninsula was a local place for us to escape. We use the word "escape" quite a bit in our posts, but the definition of that word is up for interpretation. Escaping doesn't have to mean traveling hours to go on a hike, although we would encourage that as well, but the word could just mean exploring your "backyard" like we've become accustomed to over the years. Escaping doesn't have to be this grand idea, or destination, it can be whatever you'd like it to be, and our team is lucky enough to have access to a place that makes you feel like you've escaped miles and miles away. Try to find your "backyard."
