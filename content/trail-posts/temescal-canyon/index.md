Temescal Canyon Falls, located in Temescal Gateway Park, is a great location for those looking for some physical activity without sacrificing all the great scenic views of the Santa Monica Mountains. This 3 mile loop takes you on a densely landscaped stroll on a well maintained trail that offers spectacular views above and within the canyon.

Route yourself to Temescal Gateway Park on Google Maps, and continue down the road until you end up in a rather large open parking lot. Parking is $10 for the entire day, but there is free street parking on Sunset Boulevard. Make your way down the road past the visitor center until you come up to the sign below. Stay left for Temescal Canyon Trail and Temescal Ridge Trail.

You will pass what appears to be a community hall on your right side. Continue past the gate, and take note of the sign to come. From there on, dogs are not permitted on the trail.

The first half mile or so follows a gentle and scenic path. The community does a rather great job to keep the land litter free and the trail is extremely maintained. There is little to no elevation gain in the beginning, so take your time and breathe in the wonderful and shaded view. As always we like to point out the little things that make each trail special. Below you can see a shot of us exiting from a light tunnel of trees into a bright shot of what is to come. We also weren't kidding when we said that the trail is extremely well maintained. The steady flow of tufts of green that stream along side the trail give the illusion that your trek is padded on all sides.

After about a half mile, you will begin to climb in elevation. Not much, but enough to get your heart pumping. Eventually, you will break out of the tree canopies and up the canyon walls. Below you'll see the drastic change in scenery that California is known for. Each trail has a moment like this one. The color pallet shifts from something more vibrant and floral into a dust focused myriad of smeared colors. It is only when looking out toward the clearing that you can see the two pallets collide in a chaotic mess of abstract shapes.

At 1.5 miles, you will finally catch glimpse of a bridge. The bridge overlooks Temescal Canyon Falls...or what is left of it. As you can see, the falls are absent due to the summer weather and the stream has most likely run underground for the time being. With that said, visit this spot during the winter or early spring, and hopefully there will be enough flow for you to pause. It shouldn't come as a surprise that we're a rather imaginative bunch, so when we come across sights like this we give ourselves two options: the first is to take things as they are, and the second is to imagine the site in a different time with different feet walking the trail. Both options have their benefits, but we chose to imagine Temescal Canyon Falls in its prime. We could imagine the sights and sounds of water running down the rocks and under our feet, and it gave us the same sense of calm that the real deal would. (We kind of have a thing for visiting various water fixtures in nature, check out our Havasupai Falls post).

If you had trouble picturing what we dreamed up in our heads, the photo below is of the falls during a better time of the year. It's always a great and peaceful sign to hear and see flowing water.

After appreciating whatever luck you had with the falls, continue on the loop. The trail will ascend until you reach the viewpoint. If you pay close attention, you might see a little childhood friend on your way up. We do not promote any form of vandalism in nature, but there was something about seeing the Cheshire Cat that made us pause to take a break and reminisce in the simpler and more pure times of our childhood. Perhaps this is what truly draws us out here. The pure simplicity that natures invokes in us. The return to something more pure that we can't get in an office, or even at home watching Netflix. We talk a lot about the serenity of being with nature, and up until now we've had trouble really putting our fingers on what the feeling reminds us of. It's the same feeling as looking back on your fondest childhood memories, when there was an inner peace you were unaware of and lament the loss of that feeling. Returning to nature, with or without the Cheshire Cat, creates this long lost peace that we are all so eagerly chasing with status and gain.

Temescal Canyon looks like many of the places we see in the Angeles National Forest, except it is located right beside the City. A perfect location for those looking for a quick getaway without the 2 hour mountain drive. Even being so close to the city, below is a perfect example of the type of transportive effect the trail can still have. Below, there is not one single building, not string of brake lights or cacophony of car horns, just a green wash of trees and shrubs that carry you away from responsibility, if only for a moment.

Continue past the sign below for Sunset Boulevard. The trail will begin to snake towards the viewpoint, ending with a view of the City, ocean, and mountains. As you reach the viewpoint, now is when you get the chance to take everything in. From the nature, to the City, it's all here. You've gone from a peaceful isolation in nature, to a giant atop the buildings and the trees. This trail provides the perfect escape for those wanting, but weary of, nature without running too far away from the City. However, this trail also provides a solid escape for those needing a quick get away, and a more simplistic experience.

As you complete the loop, the trail will lead you back to the parking lot. To extend your adventure, check out the map at the Visitor Center. We might come back soon and check out what other great spots this canyon has to offer.
