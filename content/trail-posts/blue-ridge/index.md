&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Ridge Trail offers one of the most expansive views
of the San Gabriel Mountain backcountry. With Mt. Baden-Powell to the west and Mt. Baldy to
the east, this powerful and humbling experience will resonate with you for your days off the
trail. The lightly-trafficked hike to Blue Ridge campground begins at the Pacific Crest Trail
Blue Ridge parking lot, and is approximately 4.3 miles out and back. You can continue past the
campground towards the Boeing station, which will add another 1.7 miles, round trip. The trail
weaves in and out of the Pacific Crest Trail, which leaves you the options of taking the fire
access road that boasts endless views of the San Gabriels, or the all consuming and
well-renowned and glorious PCT. Another great part about this hike is that the trail snakes
along the ridge of the peak that makes up the Mountain High Ski Resort.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the I-15 North, take highway 138 at the Cajon
Junction. Head west for about 8.5 miles, and turn left onto the Angeles Crest Highway
(HWY-2). You will pass through Wrightwood. After about 10 miles, turn out into the Blue
Ridge parking lot (Look for a sign that says "Inspiration Point Vista"). If you arrive at
the Grassy Hollow Visitor Center, you've gone too far. Park you car, display an adventure
pass before you make your way through the access gate onto the dirt road.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned, both the access road and the PCT take you to the Blue Ridge Campground.
Whichever trail you decide to take, you will hit the campground no matter what, so do
not worry about straying off path. During our hike, we found ourselves jumping in and out
of the PCT to keep it stimulating and refreshing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail is filled with dense pine trees, shrubs, high grass, and if you're lucky,
flowers here and there. It can be difficult to keep your eyes on your boots as the scenery
constantly changes. As always, no matter the mountain, we encourage you to take a few
breathers and really take in all of your surroundings. It's all too easy to look past the
beauty that surrounds you on the trail. With heat, hydration, and stamina on your mind it
is easy to lose the reason of why you've come out in the first place. Below you'll see the
first real greenery in one of our posts in quite some time. Tufts of green come together to
make a family quilt of sorts, with the trees serving as welcomed loose threads.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elevation gain can be quite intense at specific segments on the PCT, whereas the
access road exhibits steady elevation gain. You might find yourself huffing and puffing.
Keep your head, soak in the views, and power through. Above is just one of the many reasons
to stop and check out where exactly you stand in the company of giants. With the mountains
folded into each other, forming a glorious dog pile, you might find yourself getting a bit
lost in the view. Take all the time you need.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Blue Ridge trail passes through Mountain High's chairlifts and essentially makes
up the peaks that surround the resort. Mountain High is a special place for Two Half-Hitches
Founder and Editor-in-Chief, Franz, who actually began his profound passion for snowboarding
this past 16-17 winter season. There are an infinite amount of passions to be found outdoors,
and we're happy to see our Founder and Editor-in-Chief discover yet another reason to get outside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's great to see the benefits that the 2016-2017 wet season has brought to
Southern California. The picture below is Mountain High's reservoirs for snow-making,
and as you can see, the reservoirs are nearly filled to the brim! Living in Southern
California has a lot of perks, moisture is not typically one of them, so it's extremely
refreshing to catch this view of a filled reservoir.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to get to this point, you will have to pass another reservoir, which will
be on your left. Continue heading west until you pass another white gate. Head north up
the access gate, but do not jump back onto the PCT, instead, stray right towards the dirt
access road. Prepare yourself as this will be the most intense elevation gain of the hike.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approximately 0.25 miles, you will reach the Boeing Station. Well done! Now the
Boeing Station is not considered an "end destination" to the Blue Ridge Trail, but
something we happened on. Either way, you'll get another great view of the San Gabriel
Mountains. Take a few to check everything out before heading back. You made it this far
and it would be a shame if you didn't take a solitary moment with nature. Get the views
in when you can, and we're sure this hike will leave a lasting impression.
