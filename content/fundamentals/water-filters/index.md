Maintaining safe drinking water is vital to your expedition through the outdoors. Even the most
pristine water can be unsafe to drink, and will need proper treatment. In this video, we will
demonstrate how to treat backcountry water with water filters and the advantages over iodine tablets.

The filters shown in the video utilize hollow fiber membranes, also known as ultrafiltration.
They are capable of removing particulates and molecules from contaminated water through holes the size of 0.1 microns. These holes prevent harmful bacteria and protozoans that are too large to pass through, such as Giardia, E. coli, protozoan cysts, Cryptosporidium and other waterborne viruses. Some of benefits of using hollow fiber include: no chemicals required, backflushing the fibers to remove particulate and increase life of the filter, hollow fiber exceeds regulatory standards of water quality, and no shelf life for the fiber.

###Is Backcountry water safe to drink?
Water in the outdoors is exposed to both wildlife and humans. As the outdoors become more
heavily trafficked with explorers, the quality of water decreases. Crystal clear sources may look safe, but can carry dangerous viruses and other bacteria detrimental to your health.

###What water sources are available?
Depending on where you are going, access to water sources may be limited. Research your
destination and check for seasonal streams, access to water spigots, snow, etc.

###Why should I use water filters?
Most water filters are able to remove 99.9% of all bacteria and protozoans (including heavy
metals and chemicals depending on the type of filter) that may be upstream from your collection point. Modern water filter technology have higher flow rates, which means less waiting period for consumption, but requires periodic cleaning. Contrary to iodine tablets, water filters do not change the taste or color of water, and is a great option for those who are allergic to iodine tablets or chlorine. If you are unable to collect from clear/flowing sources, filters can prevent high sedimentation in your drinking water.

###Where should I get my water from?
Retrieve your water from clear and free flowing sources. Make sure to check upstream and
avoid collecting downstream of camping areas, areas where mining has occurred, and agricultural areas.

###More water treatment tips

- Separate clean and dirty water containers to avoid cross-contamination.
- Pay attention to manufacturer instructions. Use inlet and outlets as labeled. Keep filters
  dry and backflush if necessary to increase the life of the filter.
- Keep camp, toilet, and dishwashing areas of your camp at a minimum of 100-200 feet from
  your water source.
- Untouched snow and ice are typically clean and ready to drink. Do not eat ice or snow as
  it will lower your body temperature.
