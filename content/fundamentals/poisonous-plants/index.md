##A Guide to Identifying and Treating Common Poisonous Plants

As you trek through the backcountry, it is important to have the skill to identify common poisonous plants. Not only is exposure uncomfortable, but can be dangerous if not treated properly. The best way to harness this skill is by looking at photos, being familiar with the variety of species that commonly grow in your area, and knowing the most effective remedies.

####Rule of thumb: "Leaves of three, beware of me."

###POISON OAK | Identifying
Western Poison Oak is commonly found along the Pacific Coast in Oregon, Washington, and California, and can be found growing as a vine or a simple shrub. They are identified as having a trifoliate leaf structure, meaning there will always be three leaflets growing from the stem. Each group of leaflets will always alternate, and will never be directly opposite of each other. The edges of the leaves are rounded and wavy in appearance. The leaves exhibit a glossy green color; however, can also be a bit yellow, brown, or red depending on the health of the plant and the season. The underside of the leaf will appear to have a soft, velvet-like appearance. Poison Oak also has yellow/green small flowers that blossom in the spring.

###POISON IVY | Identifying
Similar to Poison Oak, Poison Ivy also has a trifoliate leaf structure; however, the ends of the leaves are pointed. They are typically green in the spring, and orange-yellow in the fall, and will grow white berries in the winter. Even though the name of the plant suggests an ivy, it can also grow as a shrub or a single plant, and tends to overgrow into a dense mass of vegetation. The leaves exhibit a bright to dark green color, and is waxy in appearance. The underside of the leaf will appear soft and velvety. Note: During the winter months, the leaves can fall leaving the vine intact, which can still cause rashes.

###POISON SUMAC | Identifying

Poison Sumac is commonly found in the eastern side of the United States and is much more difficult to identify - the three leaflet structure does not apply. Sumac typically grows as a tree or a sparse shrub with upward pointing leaves. Each stem has two parallel rows of leaves growing, and can have from 6-12 pairs growing from a single stem. The stems are either red or red-brown in color depending on the season or age. The leaves have an oval shape with a pointed tip, and either wavy or smooth on the sides. The leaves also change color throughout the year, starting as bright orange, to light green in the spring and summer, and red in the fall.

###Recognizing
Poison Oak and Poison Ivy contains an oily substance called urushiol that causes an allergic reaction. Depending on the susceptibility of the person, some may experience more severe rashes. The rash from poison oak is extremely irritating and will appear as red bumps, and in some cases, blisters will form. They will either appear in patches or streaks on your skin. With proper treatment, the rash will persist for 5-12 days before subsiding.

Stinging Nettle is on a different scale than the other poisonous plants. The stinging, burning, pain, and itchiness is much more intense. The rash has a similar appearance to hives, with swelling, inflammation, and white blisters.

###Treatment

1.  Wash your skin and clothes thoroughly with soap and mildly warm water.
2.  Apply calamine lotion, itch cream (e.g. cortisone), or aloe vera to relieve the itchiness.
3.  Avoid scratching - which can cause further irritation, break the skin, prolong the symptom, or result in infection.
4.  Take a warm bath in either baking soda or oatmeal (e.g. Aveeno).
5.  Use cool compresses (e.g. ice packs) to reduce swelling and relieve itch and stinging.
6.  If the rash is severe, or persists up to weeks, seek emergency attention.
