Santa Ynez Falls, which is actually a small stream at best, is located in a small pocket of Topanga State Park. Rather than a trail, this hike feels like the owner has forgotten to do landscape maintenance and the vegetation is now out of control. The backyard of the Pacific Palisades if you will. If you're in the area, we recommend coupling this with another nearby hike such as the loop trails within Temescal Canyon. Truthfully speaking, this family-friendly trail is simply not worth it. Warning: There is poison oak on this trail.

In any case, the trail guide must go on! Route yourself to the Santa Ynez Canyon Trailhead via Google Maps. You will eventually reach a gated community. Park off of Vereda De La Montura, and walk past the trail gates shown below.

The trail was very difficult to make out in the beginning. It may not look like a trail, but stay left.

Santa Ynez Canyon Trail does have some cool features here and there. Take for example this random rock formation. By no means are we climbers, but the rocks that protrude out look like something you would see at an indoor climbing gym. It's another one of those "nature reaching out to hug you" moments, but not as immersive or as gobsmacking. It is kind of neat to think of the mouth of the whale from Pinocchio as you position yourself in the mouth of the rock. Snap a few photos and continue on.

Dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge. As you walk along the trail you may start to feel a sense of claustrophobia and your hiking buddy may disappear in plain site. This is what we mean by the owner forgetting to do maintenance and now his backyard has turned into a Robin Williams-less version of Jumanji. While we've already done a good deal of complaining based on the condition of the trail, we suppose that's a bit of charm that this trail possesses. We're not often surrounded by nature on all sides quite like this. It's less of a trail and more of an excursion feel. You'll feel the phantom urge to lift your imaginary machete and start going to town on the crowding vegetation that has no sense of personal space. Light seems to interact with nature a bit differently on this trail, as there are more trees that futilely attempt to keep the light out. The sun serves as a highlighter, and constantly draws your attention with its rays. The third photo below shows of an impressive array of vegetation that you might not normally get on the trailside, but it's there, and it's another little charming aspect of the trail.

Fortunately, there are several signs that will point you in the right direction and they have certainly made themselves apparent in this chaotic mess.

In some parts, you will need to cross the stream bed, which in most cases was a brief sign of relief. As you can see in the photos below, the vegetation has finally pulled back for a moment. The empty stream bed is a sad, but welcome scar in the landscape, as it serves as a rare instance of breathing room on this trail.

The last and final sign is something that will make you turn 180 degrees, and wonder if you went the right way. The path to the falls is just a few meters to the left, and you will need to get your boots a little wet. One thing we noticed about this trail is that it's eerily similar to the visions that Hollywood has about the Post-Apocalyptic landscape of tomorrow. Everything is overgrown and overtaken by nature in a chaotic and exorbitant way that kind of gives us the creeps. We love getting back to nature, but there was a slight eerie feeling walking the trail, as if everyone has forgotten about this place. Again, be on the look out for that last sign amidst the swells of hostile vegetation.

Behold, Santa Ynez Falls...or whatever is left of it. For us, it was just a small pool of stagnant water. The falls, or stream rather, flows in early spring and late fall. We'll let you decide if the adventure is worth it. We suggest using your imagination a little bit here, as this is not the payoff you've slogged through miles of personal space invading vegetation to see. In any case, it's about the journey, right?
