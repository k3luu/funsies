&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you planning a trip to the Sequoia's and don't have a Wilderness Permit? Well head on over to Jennie Lakes Wilderness!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilderness Permits for thru hiking in the Sequoia National Park must be reserved online. If all else fails, there is also first-come, first-serve at the Visitor Center the day of, however, permits for most trails fill up extremely fast. If you're not able to grab a permit, don't be discouraged as there are still opportunities for backpacking - known as dispersed camping!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennie Lakes Wilderness is located at the center where the Kings Canyon National Forest, Sequoia National Forest, and Sequoia National Park boundaries intersect. Although Wilderness Permits are not required for hiking, you will need a California Campfire Permit, which allows you to make a campfire and use a gas or propane stove (Note: restrictions on open fires vary by conditions and/or seasons). These permits can be picked up at the Visitor Center as well.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jennie and Weaver Lake Trails are very popular, as they offer the opportunity for multiple day backpacking. Start at the parking lot of either Fox Meadows, or Big Meadows for an additional 1.4 miles.  The loop to both lakes is approximately 18.2 miles; however, the trail to Weaver Lake is a mere 6.6 miles out and back.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hike about 1.75 miles to the Jennie Lakes Trail junction, which has a moderate elevation gain. The trail snakes through Lodgepole Pines, following Red and White Firs and Ponderosa Pines, with a grand view of Kings Canyon National Forest. As seen below, the forest envelopes you in a nature-made crown of tree-tops and swirling green spires, which is a welcome change from telephone wires and neon signs. At the junction, head east towards Weaver Lake!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After passing the stream and junction, you will be greeted by the Jennie Lakes Wilderness sign.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you hit the peak, the pine curtain pulls back for momentary glimpses of the giant blue jewel that nature has charged the pines with guarding. The feeling is something similar to looking at royalty, simple enough, but somehow superior.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lake itself is breathtaking, and all the more rewarding for a job well done. Take a minute to make note of the grey giant that stands hunched over the lake, only to be broken at the base by a meager green streak that holds back the pines standing at attention far above the surface of the lake itself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure to set up camp in developed areas only. There are 15 campfire rings situated along the perimeter of the lake, mostly on the north and east side. Weaver lake not only offers dispersed camping, but opportunities for trout fishing! Unfortunately, the lake wasn't restocked during our trip. The absence of trout aside, there is so much to see if you take a moment and watch the water. From the grey spine of stones infused through the middle of the lake, to the way the water peels around each stone, and ripples compete amongst each other between shifts in wind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you wake up in the morning, make some breakfast and head back over to Weaver lake. There won't be any need to peek through the trees, the sun will meet you half way to form shadows of branches overhead, and cover you in webs of shade. Moments like these are meant to be shared, whether with a group of friends, or in the solitude of nature.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soaring granite monoliths, glacier-carved canyons, limestone caves, scenic lakes and reservoirs await your discovery. The Sequoia's provide some of the best panoramic views in a dramatic range of settings in California. With everything that is sure to be going on in the rat race, be sure to get out there and remind yourself that life, as we know it, can be much more. All it takes is a return to the universal roots of all life. You'll see it when you get there, when you're surrounded by a royal guard of pines, when you sit beside some blue majesty you've trekked miles to do just that, when you share a moment that reminds you of and binds you to the ground under your feet. Take note.
