Hoegee’s Campground is nestled in the canyons of the Winter Creek and nicely shaded under a canopy of trees. This hike-in, first come first serve, campsite perfectly serves those who want a quick getaway without sacrificing time and a bit of effort. The route to the campground follows a 5 mile, moderately trafficked, loop via the Upper and Lower Winter Creek Trail. We recommend tackling the elevation gain of the Lower Winter Creek Trail first, and then descend down the Upper Winter Creek Trail the next morning after your stay. The destination does not offer a waterfall, but you will find the serenity of the campground equally fulfilling.

Route yourself to Chantry Flats Picnic Area. There is an upper and lower parking lot. Unfortunately, the trailhead is also home to the popular Sturtevant Falls and Hermit Falls, so both lots will fill up fast. You may park along the highway and hike to the trailhead; however, your vehicle must be within the white lines or you will be ticketed or towed if blocking the lane. You must display an Adventure Pass (both parking lots and highway). On weekends, the Forest Service offers paid parking ($5-20), in which an Adventure Pass is not required, so get here early!

Head down the paved road from Chantry Flats. You will come across a sign as shown below, indicating a 2.25 mile trek to Hoegee’s. You will notice the steep decline from the start, which is why we recommend hitting this route while you have the energy.

Pass through Robert’s Camp and walk across the wooden bridge. The walk across the bridge serves as a green gateway to what is to come. Instead of turning right on the San Gabrielino Trail towards Sturtevant Falls, make a left onto the Lower Winter Creek Trail. Go around the shrubbery and prepare yourself for the beautiful canyon that lies ahead.

The landscape and vegetation along the Winter Creek trail is a sight to behold. There are several stream crossings here and there, which help to make the adventure much more enjoyable. Below, you can see the concrete dams built in place, and are a wondrous sight during the rainy season. Part of what makes the greenery on this trail so enthralling is how spread out everything seems to be, but when you gaze up you are greeted by a lush canopy of shade providing branches and leaves. However, you don’t need to look straight up to be surprised by what this trail has to offer. After the stream crossing (pictured below), you can see the waves of green rolling alongside of you as you walk the trail. While there’s no water in the stream, there is a steady flow building up around your feet on either side.

At approximately a quarter mile from the junction, you will come across this small cave, which we believe was an abandoned mine, but eerily foreshadows something or someone to come. Think in terms of Lord of the Rings symbology, and you’ll be in the headspace we were in at the time.

The wilderness cabins are a nice touch. Although we may think of structures as a mark of mankind, these homes somehow fit in. Seeing structures, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, is always heartening. Someone built these cabins out here to be close, to be away, to keep their connection to nature alive. When we come across a sight like the cabins, we feel a kinship with the stranger who built the structures. Although we know nothing about them as a person, we know that they must share our love of nature. Maybe take that mentality with you on the trail next time you run into high amounts of foot traffic. We’re all here for the same reason.

As we said before, you’re always going to have a steady stream of vegetation champing at the bit at the side of the trail. A constant companion, and a constant source of wonder out on the trail, we think the trail would feel extremely different without the rolling tides of green underfoot. If the company of greenery wasn’t enough, then you might enjoy the haunting nature of the arthritic tree limbs curling overhead. Gnarled and old, the tree limbs are equivalent to the cobwebs you would find in an untouched part of the attic. Steady, constant, and deserving of status, we enjoyed the change up on the trail.

At the 2.25 mile mark, you will finally reach Hoegee’s Campground! The site was burned down in 1953, and was formerly a haven for hikers during its lifetime. One structure still remains, and you can even utilize it as a campsite. A perfect place to adventure with friends, and fellow outdoors enthusiasts.

The campground sits at 2,500 ft in elevation and offers the following amenities:

- 14 hike-in campsites
- Vault toilets [insert check mark]
- Campfire pits (permitted only in designated areas)
- Picnic tables 
- Stoves
- Stream water (treat before consuming)
- Wooden logs for sitting

There are no trash receptacles, so pack in and pack out!

The sign at the entrance offers your standard information about the rules of the campgrounds. Take notice of the Bear Country sign. Be prepared for a bear encounter and have a bear bag ready. At approximately 6:30PM, a brown bear strolled onto our campsite and stayed the entire night. Unfortunately, we were caught off guard as the bear arrived minutes after we had eaten dinner. We ended up using an old sleeping bag case as a makeshift bear bag, but the bear ultimately outwitted us. Nevertheless, we were able to retrieve our scented belongings the next morning, and packed it out. It was a beautiful and frightening experience.

The next morning, we woke up and the bear had disappeared. To continue on the loop to Upper Winter Creek Trail, look out for the small trail sign shown in the photo below. You may think they are tombstones, but they’re your guide for the 2.5 mile hike back to Chantry Flats.

The Upper Winter Creek Trail follows a steady incline for the first half a mile. Below you can see the high tree line above the trail. When you look straight into the trees, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the deep beauty of your surroundings. Stay the course and don’t get to caught up in the vastness surrounding you. The area surrounding the trail is especially entrancing because of the swirling quality the land forms. With upturns, downslopes, and twists in the landscape itself, the area feels a bit more like a vortex, rather than a mountain.

As you break out of the tree line, you will catch a glimpse of the parking lot and the trail will begin to descend. The trail will eventually connect with a paved road, which marks the start of the Upper Winter Creek Trail. If you decide to take this route first, this is where your adventure would begin. Whichever path you choose, stick with it, take in your surroundings and above all, enjoy being swallowed up by the landscape.
