<u>Note: We DO NOT recommend this trail. The intent of this trail guide is purely informational, and to rebut any recommendations you may find on this trail from other sources. If you attempt this trail, it is recommended that you wear durable hiking pants and exercise extreme caution.</u>

A trail of blood, sweat, and maybe even tears - Mt. Lawlor should be called the “Trail of Pain.” Mt. Lawlor is an extremely rugged, but short hike, and is considered one of the lesser peaks in the San Gabriel mountains. This area of the forest was damaged by the 2009 Station Fire. The area is not maintained, and the vegetation has grown back to wreak havoc on any visitors who dare to hike this trail. There are several guides out there that talk about this trail, but truthfully speaking, this is a trail everyone should stay clear of. The trail is loose and rugged, and spotted with Spanish Bayonet, more commonly known as Yucca plants.

The trailhead can be found just north of the Red Box parking lot. From the 210 Freeway, head north on the Angeles Crest Highway for 14 miles until you reach the large parking lot and visitor center. The parking lot will be at the intersection of the highway and Mount Wilson Red Box Road.

The hike begins right off the highway, just past the trail marker shown below. The first mile follows the well-defined Strawberry Loop trail, and provides a fair amount of shade.

Once you reach the saddle shown below, the trail will subtly split. The photo shown below is the route you will take to complete the loop, and return to your car. As you can see, it is extremely steep and rugged. Based on other guides, you are supposed to continue on the Strawberry Loop Trail in the northwest direction and then hike east along the ridge of the mountain to the peak. We decided to hit this steep and extremely rugged out and back route.

The elevation gain is intense, and we can’t quite compare it to any of the major peaks in the Angeles National Forest. Seriously, we know mountains can’t actually be mean spirited, but this one felt like it was in direct opposition to our very presence. The soil is loose and gravel-filled, and losing your footing can be fatal. You may need to scramble in some areas.

<u>As mentioned in the beginning, the trail is densely spotted with Spanish Bayonet - an evergreen shrub with bayonet-like foliage as sharp as needles. This plant may look beautiful for a drought-tolerant garden, but on a trail, it becomes threatening. The leaves do not bend, and in fact, can easily pierce your skin. (By pierce, we mean bleed). During this hike, we got stabbed on several occasions and the descent felt like a matter of surviving. We can't imagine falling on one of these plants, no matter how small or large.</u>

Once you reach the peak, you may see another cairn and small make-shift register. Sign in, and join the survivors on this trail of pain. The summit offers views of Mount Wilson in the distance, San Gabriel Peak, and Mt. Disappointment. Although the views from the trail and the summit are wonderful, the amount of pain and misery does not justify the hike.
