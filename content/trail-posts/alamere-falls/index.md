&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're into waterfalls like the rest of us outdoor enthusiasts, head up to Northern California and feast your eyes on Alamere Falls! This 8-mile, out and back, hike takes you through tree groves with expansive views of Bass Lake and seaside bluffs, and ends with a 40 ft tidefall that flows directly into the ocean. We spend most of our time in the pine tree spotted mountains, so coastal hikes make for a refreshing change of pace. There are only two tidefalls in the state, and are best to experience after the winter and spring rain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigate yourself to the Palomarin Trailhead, which can be searched on Google Maps. Take Mesa Road westbound from Bolinas. Note, the last 1.5 miles to the parking lot is on a dirt/gravel road, so make sure your tires are in good condition. There is plenty of parking, but we recommend arriving around 7 or 8 am to beat the day hiker rush. Head up the stairs and make your way through the grove of trees. This is a heavily-trafficked trail, and is not dog-friendly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elevation gain over the 4 miles is gradual, so take advantage of this hike and check out your surroundings. The tree groves are typical of coastal forests, but one of the best part is that you will hit a bluff at the very beginning and will give you amazing views of the ocean, the coastline that makes up Marin County, and if you're lucky, the Farallon Islands. As always, we encourage you to take your time and really soak up these moments, otherwise, what's the point?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail continues to weave along the coastline. One minute you're surrounded with dense vegetation, and then briefly rewarded. This trail is truly dynamic in every sense of the word, and has to be one of the Bay Area's finest hikes. Bass Lake and Pelican Lake are also pit stops on the way to the falls. Breathe in the view, take a dip in the (probably freezing) water, or continue on to the falls. Below you'll see the trees bend into a tunnel, shading you from the sun, while also making you feel like Alice going down the rabbit hole. Nature has the capability to make our fantastical ideas to become fully realized and far more rewarding than we ever imagined. While something like a tunnel made by trees may seem trivial, it is one of those things that isn't experienced in the day to day rat race.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail becomes quite narrow, and sometimes steep, in some areas. You will come across a few traffic jams. Be courteous and give way to the folks coming down. The trail is not maintained, and some areas can be infested with poison oak. Be careful as you navigate through the trail. If you're not sure what poison oak looks like, check out our post on how to identify common poisonous plants! Stay on your toes. We know it's tough, especially on this gorgeous of a hike, but it's in your best interest to stay planted in the reality of the situation, and be aware of your surroundings.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a half-mile, you will hear the sounds of the ocean pounding the beach front. The euphony of that coastal noise is the indicator that your truly dynamic hike is about to pay off tenfold. Great job - you made it! Alamere falls is a four-tiered waterfall. Cross over the first stream, and scramble down the shale cliff side for the first cascade of waterfalls.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is where you will find the 40-foot waterfall. The cliff is not very stable, and getting down can be tough for some. Do your best to get a good hold, take it slow and steady, and watch for others. If you've already survived the climb down and are waiting for your friends, move over to the side. Above you can see the striking contrast between the falls, vegetation and shale. Something about this view transports us to somewhere foreign and mysterious. Tufts of green growing on the side and face of the falls really pop out at you in a surprising way. Maybe this is where that foreign quality comes from, but either way these falls have a unique quality to them that we haven't really encountered before. The beauty is sneakily embedded in hazards, as we discovered. After taking in some tips from the locals, we recommend not going down during high tide as the rocks are very slippery and the tide can easily take you in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alamere Falls is something we've never seen before. The cascade of falls fed by Alamere Creek is soothing and the roaring tidefall is incredible. As you see the water flow into the ocean, you begin to see how it all cycles together. Alamere Falls serves as a real life infographic of the cycle, which is rare when you're coming from Los Angeles. While it's easy to get swept up in the gorgeous and mesmerizing view of the falls, it is equally entrancing to think about how far this water has travelled to feed the sea. We would consider this one of the best, not-so-hidden gems in the Bay Area.
