&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timber Mountain is part of the Three T's Trail, a long, scenic loop taking you through the majestic high country of the San Gabriel Mountains that covers Telegraph Peak and Thunder Mountain. Scaling the peak of Timber Mountain is very strenuous, and all the more rewarding. Your adventure begins at the Ice House Canyon Trail head, a few minutes after the entrance to Mt. Baldy. Before you set out, you'll need an Adventure Pass and a hiking permit, which can be picked up at the Visitor Center or the parking lot.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to go during late Winter/early Spring, when snow was still capping the mountains,  but off the trails. Luckily, we didn't need crampons. Regardless, we highly recommend that you go between Spring and Fall, when the trail is safer to hike.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The beginning of the hike is scenic, as mentioned in our previous post regarding our Cedar Glen via Ice House Canyon adventure. After you hike about a mile into Ice House Canyon, you'll reach a marker for Chapman trail. Stay on the Ice House Canyon trail, and head east towards Ice House Saddle for another 2.6 miles. The elevation gain is quite steady, yet moderate. The gain can be difficult if you are not used to wearing a backpacking pack. After about 2 miles, you will hit another marker. Keep right at the fork for another 0.6 miles to reach the Saddle.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you hit Ice House Saddle, take a quick breather, because the last 0.9 miles is extremely rough. The elevation gain increases rapidly, and you may find your legs cramping up. Push yourself to make it through. If you are simply day hiking, you probably won't feel the toll on your body. However, for those carrying a pack be sure to take a break here and then, and stretch out your legs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll start to see what appears to be the peak...but that's just nature putting you in check and making you work for the views. At that point, we were exhausted, but still determined to hit the peak. That last quarter mile is an ever greater elevation gain,  but just push yourself to press on. Unfortunately, we did not take any photos from the last marker to the peak. Honestly, we were just trying to get there as quickly as possible. You'll see the marker, and if you don't we'll read about you on the news the next day. Just kidding, you'll be fine!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above clearing is just one of the spots you'll stop and feel like the moment was created just for you. Nature's reward for your beastliness and determination. Don't get too swept up in the physical exertion, or you might miss these care-crafted moments that make endeavors like this worth every drop of sweat from your brow. After the miles of sweat and cramps, you'll see a small sign:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, you made it! There's no shame in taking a victory selfie with the tangible visualization of just how high you've climbed. Go ahead, we won't tell. As you look down from the top of the peak, you'll realize that it wasn't that bad and all the effort was worth it. There was a fair amount of snow leftover at the top, and we made the most of it. Again, we were rewarded with a miniature taste of winter snow to refresh us. We advise you to take advantage of this moment if you're lucky enough to be greeted with your own taste of winter. It took us about 3 hours to summit the mountain, and once we did, we took what might have been the best nap of our lives. We nestled our tent under the protection of a tree, with a log at our side to block the wind.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow we always wake up right at golden hour, and were fortunate enough to experience the sunset. There's nothing that serves as a worthy comparison to connecting with that moment; breathing the fresh mountain air, and listening to the sounds of solitude. If your buddy ruins this moment for you, we totally support you giving them a ginger love-tap on the arm to bring them back to reality.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the San Gabriel mountains, you can't help but feel like you're standing in one state and staring at the snow capped splendor of another. Thanks California, you're beautiful in so many different ways. The trees are spread in the seemingly random binary code that can be seen in any aspect of nature, however, look closely as they all seem to peek around each other to take a look at you. These types of moments are what make the sweat worth it, unless you hate nature...then you're probably not human and this is probably not a blog suited for your soulless eyes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We come from the city, we run back to nature. Every post you read is what bonds us together as people sharing one experience together, and what binds us to the extraordinary gift of nature. These adventures are best experienced with friends and loved ones. Get off the couch, turn off your Playstation, and come play the ultimate co-op game with us. Ordinary people, extraordinary life: that's what it's about.
