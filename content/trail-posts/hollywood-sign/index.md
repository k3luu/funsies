The people of Los Angeles, or "Angelinos," consider the Hollywood sign one of those "must-do" hikes if you're in the area. The sign is located within Griffith Park, home to the Griffith Observatory, Griffith Zoo, and more than 4,000 acres of park land, making it one of the largest urban municipal parks in North America. There are 3 routes you can take to the Hollywood sign, some easier than others, but we decided to hit what is considered the most difficult: Burbank Peak ("Wisdom Tree") and Cahuenga Peak via the Aileen Getty Ridge Trail. This is a 3 mile, extremely rugged, out and back trail through the new 138-acre addition to Griffith Park with sweeping views of the San Fernando Valley and the Hollywood Reservoir.

Route yourself to the "Starting Point of the Wisdom Tree Hike" on Google Maps. Park your car on Lake Hollywood Drive and walk a quarter mile north on Wonder View Drive until you reach the trailhead. You'll need to pass the access gate and reservoir shown below. Get here early, because this is an extremely popular trail. The trail is open from sunrise to sunset, but we've seen some spectacular nighttime photos and heard some frightening stories. The time of day is up to you, but just know that Griffith Park is also home to the well-known P-22, a resident mountain lion who often traverses this area after dark.

The Aileen Getty Trail is more rugged and less defined compared to the other trails to the sign. Before you embark on this trail, take a look at the new plaque commemorating the many benefactors and community activists who raised money to save the land from a luxury housing development in 2012.

The first half-mile to the Wisdom Tree follows a steep and rugged incline. You may find a majority of visitors in running shoes, but we recommend hiking shoes, or really any shoe with solid grip and ankle support. You will gain over 700 ft in elevation within this first stretch of the hike. This trail has zero shade and can get extremely hot, but fortunately, we hiked this on a surprisingly overcast/foggy day. Just be sure to be aware of what time you set out, and how well you handle heat.

In the first photo below, you can catch a glimpse of what we mean by "rugged" trail. The makeshift wooden steps fade into the uneven dirt and rock that runs the trail. If you were wondering why we recommended hiking boots, or shoes with ankle support, look no further than these images. In all of the photos below there is a pseudo optical illusion that causes that trail to appear to "flow" downwards. While this type of trail welcomes a rolled ankle or two, we delighted in its rugged charm. Hiking this trail while the fog is still rolling around the mountain side makes it easy to feel transported to another place. You might even forget that you're hiking to the Hollywood sign. We often look out for the qualities of each hike that make us feel transported, some where far away, somewhere new.

At the half-mile mark, you will reach the trail sign below. The downhill path to the right in the photo is where you will come from. As you are reaching the top, head west for the Wisdom Tree and east for Cahuenga Peak.

Burbank Peak, more popularly and charmingly known as "The Wisdom Tree", is one of the better reasons to take this path to the Hollywood sign. There is a pretty cool geocache where you can sign your name and an American flag.

Burbank Peak is home to the Wisdom Tree, also known as the Lonely Tree, the Magic Tree, and the Giving Tree. According to the Wisdom Tree Instagram account, a man purchased the tree at a Vons grocery store and dedicated it to his mother for the wisdom she imparted to him. The original ammo box also had “Wisdom Tree Wishes” on it. On a more magical side note, the Wisdom Tree is the only tree in the area that survived the devastating Hollywood Hills Fire in 2007. What's that line from Jurassic Park? For those looking for a bit more of a meditative/introspective hike, look no further than the path that leads you to the Wisdom Tree.

After you admire the Wisdom Tree and the views from it, return to the trail junction and head east towards Cahuenga Peak. This part of the hike is mostly leveled, but there are a few areas where you will need to walk through some brush and scramble downwards. What surprises us about this trail is how it shifts from wild to tame intermittently. It may seem like someone forgot to do half of their job, but at the same time, try to imagine this hike without the charm of overgrowth and uneven terrain. Below, you'll see what we mean. A variety of plant life swallows the trail, and you along with it. The tunnels of green chew you up and spit you out into a steep decline, which is where you'll have to use those aforementioned scrambling skills. It reminded us of those scenes from the movies where someone is running through dense vegetation and has to stop on a dime when they reach a massive drop-off. Hollywood hike, Hollywood mindset.

In the photo below, you will see a small plaque, which indicates you are at Hugh M. Hefner Overlook, who is one of many benefactors that protected this land.

Continue on the Aileen Getty trail until it connects with the paved road. As you head up the road, you will notice the fence on your right, several cameras, and the LADWP station at the top. You technically cannot hike directly to the Hollywood sign, but rather, will have to stand at the top of Mt. Lee and observe the sign down below. As you can probably guess, it is illegal to climb over the gates and walk to the sign. Although it was foggy the day we went, we could still make out some of the letters. We'll have to hike to the sign on a more clear day and see the wonderful view of Los Angeles just beyond the spacings in the letters. It's interesting to note that the letters of the Hollywood sign fade into the fog in a somewhat symbolic image that reflects on the fact that film production is fading away from Hollywood proper and moving to other locations, like Georgia.

Rewinding back to the Wisdom Tree, we would like to shed some light on what it means to us. The Wisdom Tree resembles that of Shel Silverstein's unbearably sad book, The Giving Tree, and the many life lessons of unselfishness, parent-child relationship, unrequited romantic love, and the rat-race of life. As we sat at the base of the tree and read each plaque celebrating those who donated to protect these lands, we believe the Wisdom Tree teaches the greater life lesson about the bond between Mother Nature and mankind. For every trail we blaze, and every plaque we fix in its place, we must always remember that Mother Nature has been generous in giving us the gift of exploration. We all know how The Giving Tree ends, and we should keep that lesson in our minds as we're slogging up or down the trail. Gifts are great, but giving back completes the circle. As we looked out at the Hollywood sign and the City of Los Angeles beyond, we couldn't help but feel grateful that were are able to explore many places like this, and do our part to ensure that others will get to experience the Wisdom Tree, like others did for us in the past.
