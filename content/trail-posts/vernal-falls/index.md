Vernal falls is a portion of the Mist Trail on the High Sierra Loop, and is considered to be a signature hike in Yosemite National Park. The hike up to the top of vernal falls is 3 miles round trip and is rated as moderate. To get to the trailhead you must follow the Happy Isle Trail out of Half Dome Village. The hike to the Sierra Loop Trailhead is about a mile down the Happy Isle Trail that runs along the river. However, if you feel like conserving your energy you can take the shuttle from the village to stop 16 and take a short hike to the trailhead.

You can park just about anywhere in the eastern half of Yosemite Valley and catch a free shuttle bus to the trailhead near Happy Isle. The nearest parking is at the trailhead parking lot, which is just east of Curry Village. If you have no luck at the aforementioned lot, then try Curry Village. You can usually find a spot if you're willing to poke around in the back corners of the unpaved section of the lot. This is a very popular hike, so get here by 7am.

Vernal Falls is a two part hike. The first portion of the hike is 0.8 mile long fully paved path leading to the Vernal Fall Bridge. Due to the paved section of the trail being an easy hike, you’ll encounter some pretty heavy foot traffic. During the right season, this bridge holds you above a chaotic river that spills into the valley.

The bridge is a great place to take a break and gather yourself before the the last mile stretch to the top of Vernal Falls. Even though this is a heavily trafficked hike, we still like to encourage you to be aware of your surroundings, as the trail becomes a bit steep and about halfway up the path turns into shifty granite stairs that are soaking wet from the waterfall’s mist. Watch your step, as there were a good deal of puddles too deep to step in without waterproof shoes/boots. 

If you are hiking at the end of spring, towards the middle of summer, you will definitely get soaked on this portion up. Once you get past the mist of the falls, the path of makeshift steps becomes even more steep. Maintaining your footing here is a bit tough, but the ground has a higher chance of being dry past this point. After following the steps for some time, you’ll come to a one lane incline walkway. There is fencing and a rail to keep you from falling, but the walkway may still be wet.

Immediately after you’ve finished the previous part of your ascent, you’ll be welcomed with an overwhelming view from the top. The sprawling green has climbed beside you the entire ascent, and now it’s time to look down and admire the colors that have kept you company. From here you can turn around and head back the way you came. If you are prepared, and up for the challenge, you may continue on to Nevada Falls for an additional 2 miles.

There are few moments in life where you can tangibly observe how far you have come. The top of Vernal Falls forces you to do so. Vernal Falls, and Yosemite in general, remind you that once you reach the peak, there is still much more to explore. It is important to celebrate what you have done in your life, even the smallest of accomplishments. Similar to our experience at Yosemite, reflect on where you have come from, celebrate what you have done, and push on to your next destination.
