&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick throwback to Winter 2014 and our trip to one of the wonders of the world!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Grand Canyon is the United States' 15th oldest national park, and is located in the northwestern part of Arizona. At first sight, the Grand Canyon can be overwhelming, with its unique colors and formations. Fun fact: the Grand Canyon is 247 river miles long, up to 18 miles wide, and about a mile deep!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The canyon is divided by 2 regions, the North Rim and the South Rim. The South Rim is open year long, while the North Rim is open seasonally. There are many options for staying overnight, including lodging and camping reservations. If you're looking for backcountry camping in the canyon, you'll need a permit. There is an entrance fee and a camping fee, as with all national parks. Be sure to book a site in advance, months before, as campgrounds get full particularly in the spring, summer, and fall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, we decided to go in the Winter. Temperatures dropped below freezing, at around 7 degrees Farenheit, not to mention the windchill factor. Either way, we knew what we were getting ourselves into and made the most of it!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our trip, we started with a sunrise hike on the Bright Angel Trail to Indian Garden, an extremely steep, but well-defined dirt trail that descends into the canyon. With all the breathtaking scenery and wildlife, it's easy to lose track of how far you've gone.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Head down the trail, and you'll run into the Mile-and-a-Half Resthouse and the Three Mile Resthouse. Stop at each one, enjoy the views and the great company you bring along, and then continue on your way down. As we descended down the canyon, temperatures rised noticeably, where most of us found ourselves shedding layers to stay cool. Yeah, it still gets hot when the weather is below freezing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about an hour or two in, we decided to call it quits and head back. It's all fun and games until you realize that you've been descending the entire time, and now you have to hike up this colossus of a challenge. Stay positive, and you'll make it back up! Here are some tips:

1.  Take it slow, rest often, and pace yourself
2.  Drink water and balance your food intake
3.  During the Winter, wear layers, avoid bulky clothes
4.  During the summer, hike during the cooler, shaded time of the day
5.  Keep track of where you are in the canyon

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you have it! The Grand Canyon is a must see if you haven't already. Take it from us, and don't go in the winter if you don't favor the cold weather.
