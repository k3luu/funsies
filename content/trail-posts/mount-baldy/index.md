WARNING: Do NOT attempt Mt. Baldy during the winter season when snowy or icy conditions are present, unless you have mountaineering gear and experience.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6199.jpg)

Standing at 10,064 ft in elevation, Mt. San Antonio, more commonly known as Mt. Baldy, is the highest peak in the San Gabriel Mountains and is the highest point in all of Los Angeles County. The 10.3 mile loop takes you on a relentless, leg-burning ascent and is followed up by a knee-busting descent that will leave you going home with a stronger body, and more importantly, a stronger mind. Mt. Baldy is a beautiful and challenging experience, and we highly recommend this hike for all serious hikers, and those looking to train for bigger mountains. The treeless peak offers an unobstructed panoramic view of Southern California, and leaves you in a valiant, yet humbled state of mind. We truly believe Mt. Baldy is a summit to be reckoned with, and epitomizes the Angeles National Forest as an underdog in the league of national forests across the country.

If you are feeling up to the challenge, route yourself to Manker Campground. From the 210-East Freeway, exit for Baseline Road. Turn right on Padua Avenue, followed by another right on Mt. Baldy Road. You will pass through Mt. Baldy Village. Parking will be off the road at Manker Flats as shown in the photo below and an Adventure Pass is required. The trailhead begins at the access gate shown in the second photo below just left of outhouse and a visitor sign for San Antonio Falls. Start as early as possible. Parking fills up fast during the weekend, and beating the heat while on the trail is always a plus.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6106.jpg)

There are several ways to summit Mt. Baldy. You can either hike out and back, meaning you hike back the same way you hiked in, or you hike the complete loop via the Baldy Bowl Trail and the Devil’s Backbone Trail. There are pros and cons to taking different routes. Both trails have inverse qualities, such as aggressive incline over a short distance, or descent over a longer distance, and vice versa. The route types, approximate mileage, and elevation gain are as follows:

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6104.jpg)

###Out and Back 
- Baldy Bowl Trail - 8 miles RT (3950 ft elevation gain over 4 miles)
- Devil’s Backbone Trail - 12 miles RT (3950 ft elevation gain over 6 miles)

###Loop Trail
- Ascend via Baldy Bowl Trail, and descend via Devil’s Backbone Trail - 10 miles total (3950 ft elevation gain over 4 miles) 
- Ascend via Devil’s Backbone Trail, and descend via Baldy Bowl Trail - 10 miles total (3950 ft elevation gain over 6 miles)

The beginning might not be the most exciting start, but it serves as a perfect warm-up for what’s to come. The paved road follows a half mile, slight incline to the viewing point of San Antonio Falls, a magnificent waterfall that flows year-round and cascades down the Baldy Bowl. During the spring season, this 80 ft waterfall comes roaring down the canyon.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6116.jpg)

After admiring the falls and the summit of Mt. Baldy in background, follow the hairpin turn on the paved road until you reach the junction shown below (1 mile mark). The thinner, less defined trail to the left is the Baldy Bowl Trail. During our visit, there was a small trail marker, which can be easily missed if you’re not paying attention. This is the official start of the leg-burning ascent to the summit we previously mentioned. If you would rather ascend via the Devil’s Backbone Trail, continue on the paved road for another 2.5 miles, which will take you to the Baldy Notch.

<u>From here on, this trail guide will describe the ascent via the Baldy Bowl Trail and the descent via the Devil’s Backbone Trail.</u>

The Baldy Bowl Trail climbs up the southwest side of the mountain, and is arguably more intense. The elevation gain is very consistent for the first 2.5 miles to the Sierra Ski Hut, and the trail is richly covered in pine trees. This portion of the hike is mostly shaded, and the expansive view of San Antonio Canyon and the summit of Mt. Baldy are great deterrents from the soreness of your feet. Below you can see just one of the many inspiring views this trail offers. We advise taking breaks and really soaking all the sights and sounds up as much as possible.

After 2.5 miles and 2,000 ft of elevation gain, you will reach the emotionally uplifting, green ski hut. Consider this the halfway point to the summit, and your cue to take a break, eat snacks, and collect yourself physically and mentally. There are a few picnic tables and makeshift logs to rest on, and the southbound views of Ice House Canyon and Los Angeles County are beautiful.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6166.jpg)

Continue west across the Baldy Bowl to the southwest ridge of the mountain. This is the easiest segment of the hike. The terrain is characterized by large boulders that have presumably stumbled their way down from the peak over time. Take a moment to appreciate this rocky segment, because the hike to the ridge is extremely steep, and is followed by an unforgiving climb on the ridge to the summit! Seriously, take some time to just soak in the seemingly concrete dipped mountain side, as this segment reminded us of a sidewalk with some weeds growing through the cracks. Another example of nature’s ability to drop its presence into man’s influence. 

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6172.jpg)

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6174.jpg)

At approximately 3.5 miles, you will reach a checkpoint at the ridge of the mountain as shown below. The last mile to the summit gains over 1,000 ft in elevation. Consider this the home stretch! Your heart will be pounding and you may have shortness of breath as the altitude at this point is nearly 9,000 ft. As a result, your muscles are working harder. This may be a slow climb, so take as many breaks as needed.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6178.jpg)

The trail becomes less defined during this segment and even splits at several points. Keep moving towards the right, and look out for signs. Unfortunately, the actual signs were missing, but the leftover posts still served as placeholders that were enough to guide us. Below is a clearing that is abruptly halved by the approaching march of trees. The view pictured below is just one example of the color pallette on display while traversing Mt. Baldy. Towering blues that are undercut by the brilliance of bright greens and earth tones make for some dynamic and pleasing views in the middle of your potential exhaustion.

Your quads will burn, your calves will cramp, and your chest will feel like someone is sitting on it. But just as our slogan says, No Matter the Mountain.

Congratulations! You made it to the summit of Mt. Baldy! Take a few minutes to touch the plaque, sit inside the rock piles made by those who came before, and soak in the panoramic views from a mornings worth of hard work. Some of the other major peaks like Mt. San Jacinto, San Gorgonio mountain, Santiago Peak, and Mt. Baden-Powell can all be seen from the top of Mt. Baldy. One of our favorite things about this hike, aside from the incredible sense of accomplishment, is the fact that you are standing at the highest point in Los Angeles County at that very moment. It gives you that valiant, yet humbling state of mind that we mentioned in the beginning. If you’re up for it, then don’t just take our word for it. Get out there and chase those views!

The peak of Mt. Baldy is known to be extremely windy, and often creates a climate of its own. On the day we went, we were thankful for a bluebird sky and a refreshing breeze. 

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6222.jpg)

The view from the top is an exceptional breath of fresh air. Standing above the smog that bogs us down while cityside is a righteous and validating experience, and like a deep breath, the wide open of the summit loosens the restrictions placed on you by the day-to-day.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6245.jpg)

After you’ve had lunch, admired the views, and are somewhat recuperated, take the Devil’s Backbone to complete the loop. Nowadays, there are several signs that will point you in the correct direction. If you’re still unsure, the Devil’s Backbone Trail looks as the name suggests. A narrow mountain spine surrounded by boulders and loose gravel on both sides, which can be fatal if you’re not careful. 

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6205.jpg)

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6250.jpg)

The descent on the Devil’s Backbone Trail is very intense for the first 3 miles. Looking back at the summit from the saddle, the last 1000 ft elevation gain is brutal no matter the route you take. Mind your footing because the hike down is on loose gravel. The time for taking in views has passed. Focus up. Below is a view of the steep nature of the trail that snakes the side of the mountain. 

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Mount+Baldy/Content/_J8A6259.jpg)

Above you can see how small we are when compared to the mountain. If you’ve ever wondered what ants must feel like, this is a good place to start.

The above is a personal favorite from our adventure. The photo captures the meticulous maze of trees standing firm in their chaotic, but purposeful, configuration at the bottom of what reminds us of a waterslide and beyond. Once you reach Baldy Notch, you can rest outside the restaurant, grab some drinks inside, or break for a second lunch. The last 3.5 miles to the trailhead will follow that same paved road you saw in the beginning. You will eventually hit the junction where the trail breaks off to the Baldy Bowl Trail, shortly followed by San Antonio Falls. Congrats, you got it done! Don’t forget to give yourself several pats on the back for getting this one done.
