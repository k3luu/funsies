Car camping in the Angeles National Forest is like rolling the dice. Only a handful of site are reservable via recreation.gov, while the rest is first come, first serve. Fortunately, many of the sites are located in the same vicinity, so you’ll just have to hop from one campground to the other and hope you didn’t drive to the mountains for nothing! Blue Ridge Campground sits at the top of Mountain High Ski Resort at nearly 8,000 ft in elevation and offers spectacular views of the San Gabriel Mountains. Also, IT IS FREE. The ample amount of pine trees provides a nestled atmosphere and keeps the campground shaded. Despite having a nestled atmosphere, there are plenty of views to take in, as you’re pretty high up at this point. Head to either edge of the campground to snap some shots of the sprawling views. Blue Ridge Road is closed for the winter season. During the winter season, the campground is walk-in only. The Pacific Crest Trail runs along the campground, so you can hit one of the most well-renowned trails during the day. The neighboring community, Wrightwood, is also a few miles from the sites, where you can grab groceries and other services.

###DIRECTIONS
From the Angeles Crest Highway (Hwy 2), approximately 5 miles west of Wrightwood, take Blue Ridge Road 3 miles to the campground. Blue Ridge Road is not paved. It is recommended you have a high clearance vehicle, or with 4WD/AWD.
