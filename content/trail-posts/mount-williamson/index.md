One of the more picturesque trails in the Angeles Forest, Mount Williamson stands near the middle of the San Gabriel Mountain range. Characterized by it’s scenic views and plethora of terrain shifts, this hike serves as a great Saturday morning excursion on any given day. While we only saw a few people on the trail, we would wager to bet that Mount Williamson can get a bit crowded, so the earlier the better on this one. There are two starting points for this trail, however, we opted to start at the Islip Saddle and proceed from there. (See Mount Islip or Little Jimmy Springs guides for details).

As previously mentioned, the trailhead can be found at the Islip Saddle. From the 210 Freeway, head north on the Angeles Crest Highway for about 40 miles until you spot the Islip Saddle parking lot on the left hand side.The parking lot may seem large in the early morning hours, but can quickly fill up due to its location between Williamson and Islip.

You’ll immediately begin your ascent as you pass the trailhead, and maintain a constant course on the PCT for the majority of the trail. For beginners, we recommend pacing yourselves during this first bit of elevation gain, as this hike starts at a higher elevation and may lead to small bouts of elevation sickness. As you make it over the first incline you’ll spot what appears to be the peak of Mount Williamson, but don’t get fooled. Mount Williamson is actually hidden behind the first unnamed mountain, which will serve as a jaw-dropping viewpoint a bit later in your travels.

Once you’ve followed the trail for some time, you’ll notice the wide variety of trees, vegetation and unique rock formations that are scattered throughout the trail. In the morning hours, the trees pictured below provide a decent amount of shade. Following some of the more shady bits, you’ll notice another terrain shift that leads you onto the side of a rather steep mountainside that is coated with loose rocks and gravel. Not only is this a bit vertigo-inducing, but it is also an extremely narrow section of the trail, so mind your footing as you slog through this section. If you’re confident in your footing we recommend taking a peak over your shoulder to see how far you’ve come. In any case, looking at the progress you’ve made is good motivation to push through whatever barriers you’re experiencing.

Be sure to stay the course and follow the well defined trail as you ascend. There are only two switchbacks on this trail, but depending on how you’ve been pacing yourself, we recommend keeping an eye out for them and taking breaks as needed.

Above is one of our favorite sights we took in while on the trail. If we had to pick an aesthetic attribute that characterizes this hike, then this would be the one. In the photo you’ll see a tree growing alongside the trail, but what really stands out is the rocks being birthed from the tree. While this may seem mundane, it’s actually pretty fascinating to see time in action between two staples of the outdoors. Each one of these trees has its own unique swirl about them, and it was nice to be treated by so many of them just hanging out on the trailside.

Once you’ve progressed far enough you’ll come to a marker for the PCT, which also serves as the convergence of the two different “trailheads” we mentioned at the start of our post (the other trailhead is more of a turnout on the side of the road, so we recommend going with Islip Saddle). This is a great viewpoint and break area. The ground levels out and you’ll be treated to a solid valley view that carries with it the multiple layers, and depth of view that we’ve become accustomed to while hiking the Angeles Forest.

From the PCT marker, head towards the right and uphill. You’ll notice that the trail snakes between the brightly colored vegetation. Don’t be nervous, as this section of the trail is steep, but short and decently maintained. As you’re traversing the half dirt, half rocky terrain uphill, you’ll come to what appears to be a fork in the trail. Again, not to worry, pick whichever path you like, as both meet up with the main trail a bit further up. Take your time on this sections, as it is easy to slip on the rocks. Personally, we decided to go left, and saw no difference in trail composition.

This is it, the home stretch! You’ll follow the trail on the left hand side of the mountain until it wraps up to the right. You’ll know that you’re close by the massive clearing at the top of the trail. Yup, you guessed it, you’ve made it to the top! Congrats on your ascension. Go ahead and take a breather if you need to, or sign your name in the notepad under the cairn. Feel free to explore around a little bit. We made pretty good time, so we took a few to play with rocks and climb trees, and all of that good nonsense. The view from the top is just barely blocked on the west side from being a 360 view, but it’s gorgeous all the same. From the top, you can spot Islip to the southeast, Pallett Mountain to the northeast, and Devil’s Punch Bowl to the north. When you’ve had your fill, go ahead and head back the way you came and get in those views all over again. If you missed any photo ops, then now is the time to make up for those oversights. Snap some pics to get your friends motivated to come out with you on your next adventure.
