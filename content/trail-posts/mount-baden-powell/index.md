Mt. Baden-Powell was named after the founder of the Boy Scouts, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, in 1907. It was registered by the USGS in 1931, and now serves as a monument commemorating the scouting movement. On the monument you will see a few words from the founder himself, and the Scout Law. For Two Half-Hitches founder, Franz, this hike was very reminiscent, and a right-of-passage during his days in scouting.

Standing at roughly 9,400 ft in elevation, Mt. Baden-Powell is the 4th (or 5th depending on the source) highest peak in the San Gabriel Mountains and provides a stunning panoramic view of all the different kinds of terrain that Southern California has to offer. From mountains and high deserts to the city grid and beyond, this peak has it all. The 8.9 mile hike takes on you a never-ending and challenging set of switchbacks, and gains nearly 3,000 ft in elevation over a 4 mile distance. After looking at Mt. Baden-Powell from the peak of Mt. Baldy a few weeks before, we decided to hit this nostalgic peak. This can either be a beautiful stand-alone hike, or serve as training to help build strength and stamina for bigger mountains and thru-hiking.

Route yourself to the Vincent Gap parking lot. You can either take the long, scenic drive on Angeles Crest Highway (CA-2 northbound), or take the 15-freeway through the Wrightwood community. There is a decent sized parking lot that gets relatively packed during the weekends. There you will also find a small picnic table, an outhouse, and the same trailhead to <a href="/big-horn-mine-via-vincent-gap">Big Horn Mine</a>.

The hike begins at the trailhead shown below. Pass the sign and make an immediate right to jump on the PCT. Let the 40-something switchbacks begin! Unlike many big mountains that require a leg-burning ascent straight up, Mt. Baden-Powell follows a series of switchbacks, meaning you will find yourself doing several 180 turns as you walk the trail. This constant stream of zig-zags not only relieves elevation gain, but it also protects the mountain from excessive erosion.

While we’d take switchbacks over straight shot elevation gain, these switchbacks can still be tough. Be sure to take some breaks and look out off the side of the mountain. Once you clear the initial treeline, you’ll be able to get some great views of the surrounding mountains and the trees that coat them in a green patchwork haze.

At approximately the halfway point, this bench will appear off the edge. Take a seat, rest your legs, and enjoy the company you came with! Now is definitely the time to get lost in the sights and sounds of the mountain. As you take it all in, you’ll spot more and more tiny little details that are just out of sight when you’re on your feet braving the trail.

The trail is mostly shaded, and vastly shrouded with oak trees, Jefferey pines, Sugar Pines, Incense Cedar, Lodgepole Pines, White Fir, and a few gnarled pines near the summit. The variety of fragrant trees on this trail, combined with some brisk early mountain air create an extremely calming atmosphere that bath bombs wish they could come close to recreating, but there’s just nothing like getting out there and getting in some free smells to go along with the free views.

Once you reach the 4 mile mark, you will catch a glimpse of the peak. This is the homestretch, and your reassurance that the battle of relentless switchbacks is over. Look immediately to the left and take notice of the awe-inspiring canyon down below. Continue straight to reach the summit. The sign shown below is the trail junction that leads you to the Windy Gap and beyond. You can take this trail westbound towards Mt. Islip as well.

As you make the last turn around the mountain, you will see a small monument. Congratulations! You made it! Enjoy the beautiful scenery that this summit has to offer, and be sure to leave your mark in the notepad. The atmosphere at the peak of Baden-Powell is something unique. At the top, you’ll find even the most winded of hikers in good spirits, and a real sense of community with your fellow hikers. The can-do spirit of the BSA is ever present at the top of Baden-Powell, and it truly makes you thankful that organizations like BSA exist in order to create generation after generation of scouts and outdoor enthusiasts. We hope you find this peak to be as rewarding as we found it, and bring others to this place of community and spirit.
