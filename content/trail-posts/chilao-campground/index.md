So you want to go camping with your buddies for the weekend, but were unable to nag a spot at Buckhorn Campground? Check out Chilao Campground! This first come, first serve campground is just a few miles southwest of Buckhorn and offers the same amenities and a spectacular view of the San Gabriel mountains. The campground consists of 2 loops: Little Pines and Manzanita. The sites are fairly spaced from each other, so you don’t have to worry too much about your neighbors. Some sites have enough trees for partial shade and for hanging up hammocks. During the day, you can drive over to the Burkhart Trail for some fun day hiking!

###DIRECTIONS
From the 210 Freeway, exit La Canada Flintridge and head north on the Angeles Crest Highway (Hwy 2). Drive northeast for 26 miles until you reach the sign for Chilao Campground.

After you battle the heat during the day, Chilao campground offers an amazing view of the open sky. It’s close enough to civilization, but far away enough to witness the stars.
