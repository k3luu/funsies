The 2009 Station Fire ravaged much of the Angeles National Forest, and Mt Mooney is one of many areas that fell victim to the destruction. You will need to tread carefully on this hike through burnt and fallen trees, and trails that have not been maintained. Despite the negative nature of what went on here, this hike offers beautiful views of the wallpaper perfect San Gabriel mountains and the dense vegetation that has sprouted over the course of 9 years. This short 2.5 mile, out and back, hike will give you something to believe in. Nature will always find a way to rebuilt itself.

Route yourself to the Vetter Mountain parking lot, which is more of a turnout (see first photo below). The trail head begins on the other side of the street from this sign. If you see a paved road immediately followed by a fork, you're at the right place.

Both paths depicted below, although short, lead to the same trail.

The trail will shortly turn into the dirt-beaten path we all know and love. The pine trees are sparse in this part of the area, but nevertheless, stand here today. The pines seen below are a mark of how nature can outlast even the harshest of circumstances. Most of these pines are half-charred, half-dead, or somewhere in between, but even then, the tops of the trees prove to be out of the reach of destruction. We always talk about contrast in our posts, and this one won't be much different. We see a lot of different color pallets out on various trails, but the fire damaged trails always offer a bit more of a somber beauty. The dark browns, black notes, and grays clash with the newer vegetation that glows at the base of the burned pines.

After about 1 mile, the trail will begin to curve around the south side of the mountain. Make an immediate left and head westbound beyond the small boulders. The hike will become more indefinite and washed out from here, so pay attention to the markings of the trail (or whatever is left of it).

You will see reservoir tank on your left side. Ascend the east side of the mountain and be witness to the upcoming views. Below you'll see the brightness that this clearing has to offer. Without any prior knowledge of the fire that swept through, it's easy to see how someone could look past the scars the pop in and out of frame, much like the arthritic tree limb in the foreground.

We stumbled across this shelter on our way up and decided to sit down and appreciate the craftsmanship of it all. Franz is pictured below showing great appreciation for the solid lashings that keep this shelter in place. Having a strong background with the Boy Scouts of America, Franz found this shelter particularly impressive, and we'd have to sit in agreement with him on this one. There's a lot going on here. A wooden stumped rolled from who knows how far away, a make-shift rock fire pit, and surprisingly a small garden would make anyone stop and appreciate. It doesn't get any more rugged and natural than this. Whoever is responsible for erecting this shelter had their head in the right place. We can only imagine the immense sense of pride and peace that this person had as they looked up from cultivating their garden to see the wide sweeping view of greens and blues.

Continue up the mountain for another 1.5 miles and brace yourself for whats to come. The incline is by no means challenging, but the amount of fallen trees you'll need to cross is too damn high! Over and under, onward and upward, it doesn't matter to us (even if we get stabbed by a few branches). We supposed that this is one of those, "it's the journey, not the destination" type of deals. As we've been more consistent in our hikes, we've noticed that each hike has one stand out feature that really defines the hike. We went into this hike knowing that it would be different, but we didn't quite expect a literal trail of trees. The two photos below show the difference between the various fallen trees. While the first photo shows trees that are a mere step-over detour, the second shows a larger obstacle. Fallen giants pave the way, but don't be nervous to get your hands dirty and climb right over.

Below you'll see one of the aforementioned giants resting over the conflicted landscape in the distance. We say "conflicted" because it really matches our feelings about this trail. With so much beauty paired with so much desolation, it becomes hard to differentiate whether or not you are in awe of the beauty or the marks of destruction. A charred spire stands tall, a survivor in any case, while in the foreground sits a charred, mangled mess of what used to be.

We found some footprints on the way up. None of us could identify these prints, but it's nice to know that animals still pass through these areas.

Mt. Mooney may not be the most epic of summits, but this little round mountain top is a great reward for those looking to do a short hike. Since it is partly forested, you will have views of Charlton Flats to the south, the San Gabriel range to the north and west, and Stony Ridge Observatory to the east. This peak was named after Joseph Mooney, an Angeles National Forest Service ranger who died in military service in France during WWI. Below you can see the gradual transition of the levels of vegetation. While the first photo below has a bit of everything going on in it, you can still see the burnt branches extending into frame and effectively pulling focus from the washed out blue of the sky. Even in the second photo there are still signs of damage, but this time they are pulled down by the remarkable sea of green that roles over the mountain tops. Finally, the third photo shows the vegetation working hard to camouflage the scars. The vegetation invasively smothers the burnt bits, and hides them as best it can; in turn providing a distraction from the negative events from nine years past.

As we mentioned at the beginning of this post, nature always finds a way to rebuild itself. The 2009 Station Fire was formerly the largest wildfire in the history of Los Angeles County and the 10th largest in modern California history. Part of why we all decided to embark on this journey of THH was that we were all unhappy with where we were in our lives for various reasons. With the above being said, we decided that we would all make time to do the things we love, whether that meant photographing, hiking, or writing, we were going to do it. We saw an opportunity to rebuild ourselves in the essence of what surrounds us. The past few years haven't been a cakewalk by any means for our team, but regardless of circumstance we all return and rebuild in the image of something better than who we were the day before. This trail is a showcase of how to rebuild, and how to persevere. If you need that inspiration, we advise you to check this one out, as the conflicting views might just match what you're going through. As a sign off, we'd like you to take a look at the photo second from the bottom here and think about what it means to stand tall when everything else around you has fallen. Get out there, and return as something better.
