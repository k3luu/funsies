Bear Canyon Trail Camp is one of the most popular hikes in the Angeles National Forest due to Switzer Canyon and the magnificent waterfall that can be found a short distance from the trail head. From La Canada Flintridge, drive approximately 10 miles up the Angeles Crest Highway until you hit the sign for Switzer Canyon Picnic Area. Take the narrow road down to the larger parking area, hang your adventure pass, and set out on the trail or take a few minutes to relax at the picnic area!

The trail head begins at the man-made bridge. Although there's a sign for day use only, this trail offers overnight backpacking at Bear Canyon Trail Camp. The first half mile of the hike is set on a paved road, but shortly turns to dirt - both well maintained. The trees lean in towards the path, creating a sort of vacuum that sucks you into the scenery.

After a mile, you will come across a quick switchback that marks the start of the elevation gain. At first, your surrounding seems like a light stroll through the park, but brace yourself as you will get extremely intimate with the deeper depths of the canyon. This hike is characterized by stream-crossing, boulder-climbing, and face-whipping vegetation with a few areas where nature is not directly in your face. The Arroyo Seco is a beautiful and gentle sight, and more so a friend as you make your way through the canyon. Unfortunately, the stream was at a low point during our trip, but nonetheless, will say hello along the trail here and there.

As you hit the top, you will come across a sign that will make you question yourself if you've been going the right way. Fear not, you've reached nearly the halfway point. While you're scratching your head thinking 'do I really want to do this?' remember to take a look around. Remember where you started, and where you're standing at that moment, and everything nature has thrown your way. From trees leaning down to graze the path, to getting your boots a little wet, to the view of the canyon mouth. All of the above are what really make Switzer Canyon worth your time, and a place you cannot forget as you make your way through the Angeles Forest. Follow the sign towards Altadena. If you're really not sure, there will be a pole with an arrow pointing deeper into the canyon with a small engraving for Bear Canyon camp grounds. You will begin to descend back into the canyon with more brush and branches you'll have to dodge, and then a clearing for Switzer Canyon Falls and Bear Canyon.

If you have some daylight left, check out the falls! You'll probably question if you're really just miles from the city. If not, make your way to the last stretch of Bear Canyon.

After the fork, the trail becomes a bit more difficult to discern. Pay attention to paint marks and indicators on the boulders and trees. There will be smaller forks in the trail, but both ways lead to the same destination.

Our favorite part of the trail are the rock formations. Our geology is a bit rusty these days, but it's always a fun/enlightening experience to stand next to layers of cross-cutting and think about how old you are versus how old the rock formation might be. Check out all of the odd angles and varying thicknesses of each layer. When you stand there quietly and observe, it all becomes art in one capacity or another. You'll probably find it hard to pass up the opportunity to place your palms flat on the angular artwork. As you can see below, we definitely couldn't help ourselves.

Finally! The good ol' Angeles National Forest sign that serves as congratulations, but in reality, a sign of relief. According to the U.S. Forest Services, Bear Canyon Trail Camp offers only 3 hike-in campsites; however, the site can accommodate plenty. The campgrounds offer wooden tables and benches, developed campfire pits, makeshift benches, metal stoves, and several areas to set up tents. You'll find this is a place of celebration and bonding...over food because we've just hiked miles and we deserved it. In all seriousness though, as you can see below, we were happy to be there together, and grateful that we had the opportunity to accomplish another one of our little excursions.

Make sure you get some pictures while you're relaxing up top to commemorate your journey. While you're at it, make sure you take a look around you at the people you've chosen to surround yourself with and brave the trail with, they're worth the memories. We're a tight knit group of people, but somehow these experiences manage to draw us closer to each other and help us to find our footing in the world. Eternally grateful.
