Some of the most amazing places in the world require hiking in with a fair amount of gear and essentials. The beauty of backpacking stems from camping and hiking, and offers a more immersive experience. This will require you to carry all of the items that will sustain you in an efficient and comfortable way. The solution to this is a backpacking pack. Being comfortable on the trail helps to improve your backpacking experience. Obtaining the right measurements, figuring out how long you want to be out there, and making the right adjustments are the top 3 components in choosing a backpack.

##How to Determine the Size of Your Pack

Measure the distance from the base of your neck to the top of your hips. The length of your torso will determine the size of your pack. 
<div>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Torso Length</th>
			<th>Pack Size</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Up to 15”</td>
			<td>Extra Small</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>16” - 17”</td>
			<td>Small</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>18” - 19”</td>
			<td>Medium</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>20”+</td>
			<td>Large</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

##HOW TO DETERMINE THE CAPACITY OF YOUR PACK

When looking at packs you will notice the tag has a unit of measurement in liters. This is the total volume that the pack can accommodate. The length of your trip will determine the capacity of your pack. 

<div class="table-wrapper">
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Trip Type</th>
			<th>Overnighter</th>
			<th>Weekender</th>
			<th>Multi-day</th>
			<th>Extended</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Duration of Stay</td>
			<td>1-2 nights</td>
			<td>2-3 nights</td>
			<td>2-5 nights</td>
			<td>5+ nights</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Capacity</td>
			<td>20-50 liters</td>
			<td>50-60 liters</td>
			<td>60-80 liters</td>
			<td>80+ liters</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

*Note: These sizes are recommended for hiking from Spring through Fall. You will typically carry more weight during the Winter.

##HOW TO PROPERLY WEAR YOUR PACK

<h6 class="post-step">Step 1: HIP BELT/WAIST STRAPS</h6>

> Put on your backpack and have the waist strap resting above your hips. Clip the hip belt and tighten the straps. The weight should be entirely on your hips, and not your shoulders.

<h6 class="post-step">Step 2: SHOULDER STRAPS</h6>

> Pull down on the shoulder straps to tighten. The shoulder straps will pull the backpack towards your body. This will prevent the backpack from leaning backwards.

<h6 class="post-step">Step 3: LOAD STRAPS</h6>

> Pull down on the load straps until they’re at a 45 degree angle. These are located right above your shoulders. This will help remove the pressure and weight from your shoulders.

<h6 class="post-step">Step 4: STERNUM/CHEST STRAPS</h6>

> Buckle the chest straps and tighten to a comfortable length. This will allow you to move your arms freely and pull your upper body more inwards.

<h6 class="post-step">Step 5: FINAL ADJUSTMENTS</h6>

> Once all components of the pack are strapped and tightened, loosen/tighten once more where needed. Property fitting doesn’t happen the first time around, and it’s important your body is relieved of as much tension where possible.

###BACKPACKING TIPS FOR BEGINNERS
- Condition your body. Wearing a backpack will require more strength, stamina, and endurance.
- Backpack with friends and family who have some experience.
- Plan an overnight trip at a location close to your area.
- Borrow clothes, gear, and a backpack. This will help save money and build your preference in the future. If you are a student, some colleges allow you to rent equipment. A few sporting good stores do the same.
- Dehydrated meals are an efficient and easy way of bringing food. Trail snacks rich in nutritional content are always a plus.
- Pre-wear your backpack to get all the adjustments right.
- Test your limits. Choose a trip with shorter mileage and elevation gain.
- Choose a highly-trafficked trail. You’re bound to run into some fellow backpackers who can help you.
- Choose a location with a source of water.
- Consider backpacking during the warmer seasons.
