Take a hike to the remnants of the Vetter Mountain Fire Lookout that was lost to the devastating 2009 Station Fire, the largest wildfire in the history of Los Angeles County and the 10th largest in modern California history. This 4.1 mile, lightly-trafficked, out and back/loop trail takes you on an eerie and sorrowful hike through the heart of the San Gabriel mountains. The trail is nearly entirely paved, with some access to dirt trails and bushwacking. Please note, the trail has several areas overwhelmed with Poodle-dog bush, a shrub known to cause serious skin irritation.

Navigate yourself to the Charlton Flats Picnic Area (searchable via Google Maps). Park in the turn out, display an Adventure Pass, and walk past the Charlton Flats gate onto the paved fire access road. Charlton Flats does not allow overnight camping, but it is a great place for day picnics.

As you make your way on the paved road, look out at nature's hard work over the past couple of years. It's a wonderful feeling to look out over the lush green that can be seen for miles, and the bright, cloud interrupted sky that blankets it all together for one comforting view. Like a few of our past hikes, we're always enamored by just how many shades make up this "lush green" thing we keep going on about. It's like someone gave a child a bunch of green crayons and said, "fill in the lines." We mean the previous statement in the best of ways. The organized chaos of color we're treated to on these hikes is perhaps one of our favorite aspects of getting outside.

Keep left on the paved road, and you will reach a sign for the Vetter Mountain trail. Pay attention to the signs as some trails are off limits for rehabilitation purposes. Below you can spot some pictures of the paved trail. While fully paved trails aren't our favorite way of traversing the wild, we see their merit in the sense that they are wonderful beginner trails. Everyone has to start somewhere, and this trail feels very accommodating to the needs of those who are looking to get their start.

If you decide to hit this trail, be wary of the plant shown below known as Poodle-dog Bush (Eriodictyon parryi). This tall Californian mountain shrub causes severe irritation to the skin if touched, similar to poison oak or poison ivy. It can raise blisters lasting as long as two weeks or more. The plant is covered in sticky hairs, which can dislodge easily and can be passed on to hikers who touch it or brush up against it. The swelling, rash and itching appear twelve hours to two days after contact. You will come across this frequently during the hike, and it gives off a pungent smell. Use caution and avoid this plant.

As stated before, this is not the most exciting trail, but there is an opportunity to use the south bound Silver Moccasin Trail. Exercise caution when using the trail. Navigating to Vetter lookout is fairly easy as the trail signs are clear.

At the start of this post we had made mention of a fire that destroyed much of the surrounding area. Below you will find testaments to the fire's might. Even this many years after the fire, the area is still recovering from the damage done. You'll see trees that more closely resemble an arthritic hand, than an actual tree. Trees that were cut down by the fire, seemingly sympathetically standing at half-mast for the lost trees. We were personally reminded of what our editor, Colt, had told us about the current post-fire state of Santa Rosa. The way he described the chaotic disorganization of the manner in which the fire burned is something we thought about heavily while walking through these pockets of desolation. Thinking back on a trip we took to visit Colt in Santa Rosa, we recalled driving on a back road through one of the more rural parts of the area and thinking that it was a beautiful thing to be this close to nature. Now when we see the effects of fire on this trail, we think of the total devastation that fire is capable of bringing, and we think of the ways in which it can drastically affect us, as well as nature. Walking this trail gives you perspective, while also humbling you in the greatest of ways.

Once you get out of the obstruction and chaotic mess of the fires, you will begin your uphill battle. This is where most of the elevation gain will come in. Don't worry, the fire lookout is just few yards away. The trail will intersect with the fire access road, and you will find yourself spiraling your way to the top.

The Vetter Mountain Lookout was lost in the 2009 Station Fire. Today, a temporary structure is used to maintain fire lookout services and the Angeles Nation Forest Fire Lookout Association is in the process of rebuilding this historical site. The devastation that shook the Angeles Forest was considered the largest wildfire in the history of Los Angeles County. Neighboring cities down south, including Pasadena, Glendale, La Canada Flintridge, among several others, faced mandatory evacuations. On September 3, officials announced that the Station Fire was caused by arson and that a homicide investigation had been initiated because of the deaths of the firefighters involved. Over 106,000 acres were burned, and the history of it all is still apparent today. Although this post was a heavier one to write, there is knowledge to be gained from all of this doom and gloom talk. Yes, we saw the mark of almost a decades of path of destruction, but we also saw nature fighting back in large brush strokes of green. If there is anything we learned on this hike, it is that, like nature, we will always strive to find our way.
