Henninger Flats is a scenic, heavily trafficked trail located in the San Gabriel Mountains, and overlooks the City of Pasadena and beyond. Although not the most conifer-filled hike, the trail is almost entirely on a toll-road up until you hit the flats. For day hiking, park at the Eaton Canyon parking lot, walk north across the wash and turn left (north), then walk approximately one-half mile to Walnut Canyon and climb the steep, windy horse trail, which meets with the Toll Road. Take the Toll Road uphill. If you're planning on staying overnight, take the Toll Road all the way from the Pinecrest gate. To get to the Pinecrest gate, go north on Altadena Drive one mile past the entrance to Eaton Canyon. Turn right on Crescent, then right again on Pinecrest. Observe parking signs carefully as parking enforcement will ticket you. Pass through the gate off of Crescent, and you will find yourself walking across a bridge.

After that, it's literally all up hill (and fairly strenuous). Henninger Flats is a popular hike, and an alternative to hiking below to Eaton Canyon Falls. Dogs are allowed, but must be leashed.

The flats offer 30 hike-in campsites, bathrooms, designated firestoves, and even a tree nursery. The campsites are broken down into 3 tiers: Lower Campground, Upper Campground, and Fuji Campground. In order to camp, you'll need to grab a permit at the Visitor Center at the top, which is operated by the Los Angeles County Fire Department (Bring a Photo ID).

Settle in, set up camp, and then take in the panoramic view that really sums up Henninger Flats.

As the night gets darker, the city lights get brighter. We couldn't help but think about the balance between the urban lifestyle we live during the week, and the rugged, outdoor lifestyle we live for on the weekends. At the end of the day, it was a disparate, yet beautiful and connecting experience.
