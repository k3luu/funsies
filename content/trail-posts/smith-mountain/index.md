Smith Mountain, located 30-45 minutes north of Azusa, is one of the more underrated and less traveled trails in the San Gabriel Mountains. Dominated by dry shrubbery and god-awful Spanish Bayonet, this hike provides a dynamic adventure with its challenging elevation gain, bush-whacking segments, and technical terrain. The defining factor that separates this trail from all others in the Angeles National Forest is the last half-mile to the peak. The final 800-ft scramble over a half-mile ascent presents a great challenge for both seasoned hiking veterans and newcomers. Hiking boots, pants, and long sleeves are recommended.

Route yourself to the Smith Mountain trailhead—approximately 16 miles north of Azusa on San Gabriel Canyon Road. The parking lot is located just before Coldbrook Camp and is a large turnout. You will find an outhouse, trail signage, and trash receptacle. Depending on start time, the mountain will provide some shade in the early morning. There is absolutely no shade the first 2.5 miles of the trail if you hit the trail later morning to early afternoon. Bring a hat, sunscreen, and at minimum, 2L of water. We started in the early morning around 7:30 AM, so we were shaded by the eastern ridges of the mountains during the first half of the hike.

The trail will send you west along the highway you just drove on. The elevation gains quickly over the first mile, so pace yourself and take breaks where needed.

Take a few moments to admire the view of valleys and ridges weaving together to form the San Gabriels. Be sure to take notice of the steep rock formations guarding the trail.

Beware: Spanish Bayonet can be found on this trail, and in some places, may obstruct the hike. Carefully pass through them as to not touch them. They are not poisonous, but a slight brush or poke can pierce your skin. Based on the photo below, it looks like some of them were cut at the tips.

The peak of Smith Mountain rears its head at the first mile marker. You will see pine trees lining the north face of the mountain and boulders protruding from the greenery. As the trail meanders back and forth, Smith Saddle will come into view.

The saddle is where the trail will split. You can choose to continue west along Bear Creek Trail, north for what appears to be another peak or head south towards Smith Mountain. Take a short break at the saddle because the next half mile is where the real challenge begins on this hike.

The ascent to Smith Mountain can be brutal. The elevation gain is relentless, the trail is comprised of loose gravel, and the terrain becomes increasingly technical as you progress. Since this hike is less traversed, the trail is less maintained. You will find yourself walking through and under bushes.

Now, the best part is the scramble. Scrambling means to walk up steep terrain while using your hands. In a sense, this is considered climbing. If you do not feel comfortable scrambling or lack the ability, you may turnaround at the saddle. We always encourage people to push themselves but also recognize their limits—safety first.

At the quarter-mile mark, you will reach a clearing. Catch your breath, eat a snack, and admire the views.

Continue scrambling and watch your footing as you make your way to the top.

After a 2.5 mile ascent and half-mile scramble, you have now made it to the peak of Smith Mountain. There will be a USGS placard on one of the rocks signifying Smith Mountain as a registered peak. Celebrate another peak in the books, take in the views once more, and cautiously make your descent the same way you scrambled in.
