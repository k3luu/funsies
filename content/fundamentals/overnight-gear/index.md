##OVERNIGHT BACKING GEAR
In our video, we will prepare you for an overnight backpacking trip. Check out more useful tips below!

###Gear Tips

- Equip yourself with the Ten Essentials - time-tested, with the basics for safety and comfort.
- Pack light and smart. Stay away from excess items and stay under 30 pounds.
- You may not need all ten of the essentials, but it's a good habit to bring them just in case.
- For 1-3 days, we recommend a 35-50 liter backpacking pack.
- For 3-5 days, we suggest a 50-80 liter backpacking pack.
- Try renting out packs if possible. It'll help build your preferences.

###Destination Tips

- For beginners, we recommend starting with a one-night trip.
- Keep the round-trip distance to 10 miles or less.
- Travel with friends, preferably one with outdoor experience.
- Consult informational resources: website, magazines, books, park forest services, etc.

###Clothing Tips

- Stay away from cotton, and instead wear technical clothes, such as moisture-wicking polyester.
- Wool packs more heat than cotton.
- Convertible pants are ideal for regulating your body temperature.
- Wear head cover (e.g. hats, bandanas, etc.). You'll be surprised what shading your face can do.
- ALWAYS bring rainwear. Even if rain is not in the forecast, rainwear can shield you from bug bites.
- Bring a core jacket, or insulation layer, for colder nights.
- Layers, layers, layers. Stay away from bulky jackets.

###Food Tips

- The most convenient way is to go with freeze-dried foods.
- Pack snacks (e.g. trail mix, jerky, energy bars, sun-dried fruit, etc.)
- Stay away from heavy cans and containers.
- Stow your food away from your site. Hang a bear bag, or use a canister.

###Water Tips

- Bring no more than 2-3 liters of water.
- Save yourself the extra weight, and pack water purification tablets or a water filter.
- Make sure your hike has an accessible water source.

###Hiking Tips

- Wearing a backpacking pack will slow you down considerably, so take your time and remember to take breaks!
- Stay on the trail, and avoid cutting switchbacks. Respect the land!
- Look up every once in awhile, and appreciate the views!
