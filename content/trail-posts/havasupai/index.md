##“The people of the blue-green waters”

Havasupai Falls is one of the most beautiful waterfalls on Earth, and serves as one of the best backpacking trips that you need to experience in your lifetime. The natural blue-green beauty of the water is something that will stick with you forever. There are few times in your life in which you get the privilege of witnessing something so naturally beautiful that it seems foreign.

You MUST make reservations and obtain all necessary permits prior (Day hiking is not permitted - you will be cited and escorted out of the reservation at your own expense). Reservations are usually accepted for the calendar year beginning in February and require inputting the number of days/nights of stay and number of people in your party. Unfortunately, you cannot make any cancellations or add people/days to your reservation once completed. All fees are due at the time of the reservation, and only one credit card may be used. Check out Havasupai Reservations for more information and pricing. Depending on your luck, you may be hiking this on any day of the 4 seasons. Our trip was done late November 2017.

We drove to the parking lot the night before and pitched our tents on the dirt plateau right beside the lots. We woke up at around 5AM the next day and caught this beautiful glimpse of the sky, just minutes before the sun rose over the canyon. Everything was awash with a dusty pink filter, as seen below.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_7885.jpg)

Lock your cars (don't forget your keys), double check your backpacks to make sure you have everything, and then descend into the canyon. Make sure to bring your Driver's License or an acceptable form of identification, and remember the license plates of all vehicles in your party. You will need it for checking in at the reservation office.

The descent into the canyon aggressively drops 1,000 ft from the parking lot and follows a series of switchbacks. Although the descent plummets you down, the sides of the trail intermittently come out to hug you as you stay the course. As you look out to your left you can see all the colors of the landscape bleed down into a beautiful mixture of everything this area has to offer.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0471.jpg)

After about 2 miles, you will be greeted by a sign that says "Hilltop" at the bottom of the canyon. Look out for this sign on your return. This will be the marker to take a break before you must aggressively ascend the canyon.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0494.jpg)

At first glance, the trail is absolutely breathtaking. You will find yourself sunken into the colors of the painter's pallet that you saw earlier on the trail. You'll mix in with the dirt, dust, and canyon walls. We often talk about charming aspects that are unique to each trail, and something we found charming about this canyon were the amount of rocks, and boulders littering the ground next to us as we continued on. You will eventually see some pack mules. Yield to them and continue through the canyon. Unfortunately, our point of view is limited to a short, bipedal view that does not allow us to always take in the full scope of our surroundings. Truthfully speaking, the canyon can become mundane after the first mile or two, but look up and appreciate this grand scenery that many people may not have the opportunity to see.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0522.jpg)

When you look up, try to match the canyon walls to each other. Sure, natural erosion has seen its job done here well before we were born, but it remains an entertaining pastime to look up and try to make the pieces fit. Don't stare up for too long though, you've got a trail to navigate! Some areas are slow from the sand and gravel, and the trail will split quite often. Simply follow the river bed, and you will reach the reservation.

After about 7 miles, you will reach this sign for Supai that indicates you are almost there. The camping reservation office is about 1 mile from this sign. As you can see some of us are excited and optimistic, while others are just beat. Cross the bridge and you will reach the reservation office in no time. We were graced with ideal weather during our hike, low 70s to be exact. In the summer, temperatures can get toasty and hiking without shade can be hell. Wake up as early as possible and beat the sun.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0528.jpg)

We passed by a portion of the village, and decided to stop taking photos. Per usual, we always find it interesting how we position ourselves in nature, whether it be as hikers, backpackers, or settlers, we find a way to try to coexist with nature.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_8015.jpg)

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_8018.jpg)

After you've completed the paperwork and received your wristbands from the reservation office, the campground is another 2 miles. You'll probably be extremely exhausted at this point, but keep pushing! Take a break at the small cascade of pools on your way to the campground, where you'll find many other visitors and locals doing the same. The falls below are a series of falls known as Fifty-Foot Falls, Little Navajo Falls, and Old Navajo Falls. Getting to this point of your journey and seeing these uniquely colored waters will make you feel like you've hit the jackpot and come up on a mini oasis, and honestly, that's exactly what they are.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0530.jpg)

As the trail descends into the campground, you will pass the namesake falls of the area: Havasu Falls. I can vividly recall the first glimpse of Havasu Falls. You may have seen photos and videos on social media, but in person, the size and color of the falls is unmatched. Stop and admire one of the majestic gifts of nature.

The color of the water is a result of having been stored underground in limestone caverns and aquifers for thousands of years. Underground, the minerals are leached from the limestone and result in the beautiful turquoise color. Naturally unnatural.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0541.jpg)

Below you'll see the falls. Before you scroll any further we suggest that you slowly scroll down to reveal the full picture. In doing this, you may be able to feel some of the wondrous shock that we experienced as we got our first, in real life view of the falls, and the resulting pool at its feet. It may feel strange to see the turquoise against some of the more familiar colors you've seen on many other trails. Every trail has something that sticks out, and for this one, well, a photo really is worth a thousand words.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_6365.jpg)
![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0552.jpg)

There are several sites at the campgrounds, some better than others. Take some time to look around and find the one that best suits the size of your group. The piped spring shown below is the only water source at the campgrounds, which is tested for drinking standards. Set up shop, eat lunch, and relax for a moment. You've earned it.

You are responsible for bringing your own food. There is a small convenience store and restaurant, but both are about 2 miles away from the campgrounds. There are composting toilets, picnic tables, and plenty of open space to set up tents, but no showers. There are absolutely no campfires allowed, with the exception of backpacking stoves. There are plenty of trees for setting up hammocks. We saw some people sleeping on hammocks rather than in tents.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_0374.jpg)

By the time we got to the campgrounds, the day had passed and night was already falling. We decided to hit Mooney Falls and Beaver Falls the next morning, which is approximately 7 miles out and back from the campgrounds. Although the area is known for Havasu Falls, we believe Mooney and Beaver Falls are even better. Make sure to bring the Ten Essentials with you on your day hike to the other falls. You will also need water shoes for this hike.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0574.jpg)

Descend at your own risk. The way to the bottom of Mooney Falls is extremely dangerous. You will need to descend 200 ft into a cave, climb a wet and slippery ladder, and rappel down a few chains. The mist from the roaring falls coats everything, and the moss is extremely slippery. This is the only way down, and serves as the continuation to Beaver Falls thereafter.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_0487.jpg)

Take your time, give the person in front of you space to get to each checkpoint, and make sure you have a good grip. It almost felt like we were in a game of Uncharted or Tomb Raider, except this was real life and we weren't trying to steal sacred artifacts. If you are uncomfortable with confined spaces and heights, or lack in your scrambling abilities, we recommend observing the falls from the top. A fall from this height can be fatal.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0582.jpg)

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_4592.jpg)

If you survive the descent, Mooney Falls takes on a whole new and glorious perspective. As water flows, the limestone minerals are deposited, resulting in the travertine rock formations shown below. Water fluctuations and floods alter the stream bed, and produce these unique formations. Mooney Falls is the tallest out of the 5 total waterfalls. Below you'll catch a great shot of some of our trail crew standing at the foot of the waterfall. While we took plenty of photos of each waterfall on its own, we find that inserting ourselves into the frame helps present the real scale of this natural fixture. A beautiful falling tower of water; Mooney Falls is a marvel to look at behind a computer screen, but becomes even more jaw-dropping when you stand at the foot of the giant itself.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_0563.jpg)
![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG-3093.jpg)

Continue past Mooney Falls and onto Beaver. There are boards and logs to traverse on, but the water is no more than 3 ft deep in most areas. Either way, be careful. We've spoken on the concept of feeling like a stranger in a strange land before, and the unntatural beauty of this altered water gives us the same feeling tenfold. Even as we look at the picture directly below, we don't quite seem to fit in, and yet, we do.

![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/GOPR0593.jpg)
![](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/twohalfhitches/trail+guides/Havasupai/IMG_6515.jpg)

One of our favorite moments of the hike is the view shown below. The trail can be difficult to follow and will require several stream crossings. Your way to Beaver Falls may not be the same route on your return. Havasupai offers guided tours, but for us, part of the adventure was finding our own way.

At this point we had become familiar with dirt and dust coating our feet, so you can imagine what an absolute treat it was to be blessed with this view of a green riddled canyon floor. The greenery separates the strong shoulders of rock that preside over the canyon floor, which makes it seem like two different ecosystems colliding and splashing around right overhead.

At approximately 2 miles, you will reach the sign for Beaver Falls. You can gaze from the top, but the base is also reachable by foot. Beaver Falls is the farthest and most remote from all other falls. The cascading falls and shallow swimming pools set this apart from all of the falls before, and is stunning and tranquil in its own unique way. Beaver falls was very enjoyable, but for us, it was more about the adventure of getting to it. As you traverse every obstacle, bravely cross each stream, walk atop each foot bridge your mother would beg you not to use, and hike through every dense wall of brush, like a scene straight out of Jurassic Park, remember that it is not always about the destination, but sharing in an adventure with the people you enjoy, and who will share this moment with you for as long as they have breath in their lungs.

"The Havasupai people, or Havasuw 'Baaja, the people of the blue green waters, are the traditional guardians of the Grand Canyon. Related to the Yuman, the Havasupai have from the beginning, inhabited the Grand Canyon and its environs. By 1919 with the establishment of the Grand Canyon National Park, the Tribe was restricted to 518 acres, 5 miles wide and 12 miles long in a side canyon. The Tribe has since had returned to them 188,077 acres of their former homelands which makes up their reservation today. Havasu (Cataract) Canyon, now the permanent home of the Havasupai Indian Tribe, is internationally known for its blue water and spectacular water falls adorned with travertine columns, shelves and skirts. Topography of the plateau areas varies from rolling, gentle slopes, to escarpments of outcrops of the Kaibab Limestone. The Havasuw `Baaja, draw their strength from the land, which is sacred. Visitors are asked to preserve the magnificence of the Havasupai homeland and respect their natural resources which contribute to their spiritual direction."
