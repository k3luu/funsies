Trail Canyon Falls is a 30 ft waterfall cascading down a canyon, and is less traveled compared to many in the Angeles National Forest. This roughly 4 mile, lightly-trafficked, out and back trail takes you through the western regions of the forest. Although this area may be known to have less pine trees and more shrubs, we found this hike to be very rewarding and adventurous all the same.

Route yourself to Trail Canyon Trail (yes, they decided to name it twice). Rather than driving up the Angeles Crest Highway, you'll want to continue west on the 210 freeway and exit for the City of Sunland. Exit Sunland Boulevard, make a right on Oro Vista drive, pass through a residential neighborhood, and then eventually the road will spit you out onto the mountainous roads we all find comfort in. Pull off to what appears to be a turnout with an access gate. Display your Adventure Pass, and make your way up to the trailhead.

The trailhead actually begins about 300 ft past the gate. Stray right on the fork. You will come across some private property where the dirt road will diverge, so be sure to pay attention to the signs. You will be greeted by an information sign.

The trail is mostly shaded for the first mile through the canyon. We decided to hit this trail around 8 in the morning, so the sun was just about over the ridge of the mountains. Below you'll see one of our favorite images from the trail. The stones that line the left side of the trail appear to be acting as a levee holding back the lush greens from pouring onto the dirt beneath our feet. A beautiful reminder of what is always at an arms reach from us all.

You will eventually come across this sign after the last cabin. Although the trail has not been maintained by the US Forest Service, and the vegetation can be quite dense in some areas, the way to the falls is fairly easy to make out. WARNING: There are several areas infested with poison oak/ivy. We recommend wearing long sleeve shirt and pants for protection. If you want to learn more, check out our Fundamentals post on How to Identify Common Poisonous Plants.

Although the trail isn't maintained and you'll have to stay a bit more aware of your surroundings, it is definitely beautiful by design. For about a half-mile, you'll be crossing streams, bush-wacking to some extent, ducking over and under vegetation, all while shaded by the canopy of the trees. There is little to no elevation gain through the canyon until you reach the wash. During the hike, we counted about 9 stream crossings each way - 18 total. There are some logs and wooden planks to assist you in making the crossings. Hikes like these easily transport you to a completely different space. You'll feel less like you're in LA County, and more like you've gone somewhere foreign, somewhere you strangely belong.

We found it very interesting to see how far we had hiked through the canyon. After taking in the sweeping views from the wash, prepare yourself for the elevation gain. This part of the trail can be difficult for some, and there is absolutely no shade for the next mile. Pictured below you can see the mountains weave together to create a dense, green dog-pile of majesty. We realize that the previous statement sounds a bit silly, but trust us, you'll get it when you arrive. As we mentioned at the start of the post, this trail is lightly trafficked, and the second photo below encapsulates the serenity of the trail on a particularly light day. Don't forget to take a look up towards the mountains. It really is something to see the sky cusp the top of a giant.

At around 2 miles, you will catch your first glimpse of Trail Canyon falls. It almost felt like an oasis, or a hidden gem that we happened upon. It was definitely a morale booster after hiking up the mountain and seeing the end destination. Again, we call back to that sense of being transported somewhere you don't necessarily belong, but somehow feel like you were meant to be. Just looking out and watching the water whisp down the rock face instills a sense of peace, especially if you're from LA. It isn't often that we get to take a moment to just gaze out at a waterfall, and for that moment we were beyond grateful.

The trail will fork once more. Left will take you to the top of the falls, while right takes you to the base of the falls. We recommend taking both for different perspectives. If you decide on going down to the base, you'll need to traverse some steep terrain that may require your hands to do some work. A rope should be present to help you get down, and should be extremely helpful for those who hike this after a good rain.

Trail Canyon Falls by all means isn't the grandest or most breathtaking falls we've seen, but there's something about it that leaves a solid impression on us. Maybe it's the way it is nestled in the canyon, hidden among the towering rocks and blanketing trees, washing down a moss-covered wall into a gentle pool. It could even be the fact this waterfall has less people than places like Sturtevant Falls or Eaton Canyon Falls. Either way, we thoroughly enjoyed it, and we're sure you will as well! Gather around the pool with your friend, or friends, and share in a brief moment of worrying about nothing at all. As always, don't forget to take a break, have some snacks, and appreciate this little hidden gem.
