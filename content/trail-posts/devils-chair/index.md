A spiraling journey down the 9 circles of Hell? Not quite, but Dante might approve. Far from a hellish journey, The Devil's Chair is a 7.5 mile lightly-trafficked, out and back, trail through the high deserts of the San Gabriel Mountains! Quite different from the rest of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Devil's Punchbowl is characterized by overwhelming natural landmarks and stark geography. You will have to weave through stunning rock formations and spotted pine trees, and carefully tread across 2-foot wide trails to reach this 360 panoramic view of the chair and the vast geology that makes up the punchbowl. If you're a geology enthusiast, or just have an appreciation for interesting rock formations, this is the hike for you. 

Route yourself to the "Devil's Punchbowl Natural Area" and you will arrive at a moderately sized parking lot. The gate supposedly opens at 9AM, but we arrived at 8AM to find a few other early birds ready to hit the trail. Parking is free, but the lot closes at dusk. The trailhead can be difficult to find, but take a look at the photo below. Head directly south of the parking lot and you will reach a sign for the Burkhart Trail.

Check in at the sign-in sheet for good measure, and make sure to sign-out when you return.

You will come across this sign (pictured below) in a few hundred feet. As you can see, it's not the most technical map, but it does give you a general idea of what direction you'll need to go and what junctions you'll hit on the way to the chair. Looking at the map, the first half takes you southwest, then begins to curve east for the chair, and finally snakes down to the Devil's Chair.

The views are expansive and a sight to behold from the start. The first of many jaw-dropping views we got is pictured right below. Needless to say we lingered for a moment to appreciate how the greenery bleeds between the bulbous rocks. Maybe the ominous tone of the name The Devil's Chair had us thinking a bit on the macabre side, but in the center of the photo below, it looks as if the rocks form fingers that clutch the green. It's a bit out there for us, but hey, so was the view!

At about a quarter mile from the trailhead, you will reach a water reservoir. Take this as an indicator that you are heading in the correct direction. On the way back to the parking lot, this reservoir will give you that reassurance and motivation on your trek back by knowing you're nearly back where you started.

Continue on this unnamed trail for approximately 1 mile and you will come across a junction. Stray left for the Devil's Chair and South Fork, or you can hike 11.5 miles to Buckhorn Campground. The best time to hike this area in general is during the early spring and late fall. This part of the San Gabriels can get extremely hot and dry, which is a concern for heat-related illnesses. Plan ahead, bring enough water, and you should be good to go!

The trial is well-maintained for the most part, and you may notice there will be mile markers, which may be some motivation for others. The terrain on this trail changes quite frequently. Below you can see a photo that is almost vertigo inducing due to the way the landscape has shifted, and the trees with it. A uniquely beautiful view, albeit a tad strenuous on the eyes, that really stuck out to us. If we had to coin this type of experience, we'd probably go with something like "Nature's Kaleidoscope."  The second picture below gives us a really good look at what we mean by erosion and literally 2 feet wide. The mountain crosscuts the sky with its shifting dirt, only to be interrupted by the reappearance of the trees down the trail. While all of this is dreamy, again we want to stress that certain parts of the trail have been washed over by erosion, and span only 2-feet wide in some areas, so watch your step!

As you make your way through the punchbowl, you will have several opportunities to admire Antelope Valley to the north, Pinyon Ridge and Holcomb Canyon to the east, and the Arroyo Seco to the west. The contrast between the high deserts and pine forests of the San Gabriels is quite apparent on this hike. You just can't help yourself but to take a moment and appreciate the setting. It's very important to take breaks on your way and simply admire what surrounds you. Below you can see why everyone says that California has it all. The transition of colors fading in and out of each other as you look more and more towards the horizon is a fine showcase of what California has to offer. Tie all of this in with an oddly placed sliver of cloud, and you've got yourself something to write home about. Waterfalls of greenery pour out over the sides of mountains to meet your eye-line at any angle. Standing on a rock formation (which oddly resembles a cat) and gazing off over the edge at all that surrounds you always proves to be a deeply humbling experience. While it may be a cliché, these moments really do make you feel small in the shadow of something greater, and clichés became worn out because they so perfectly described something. No harm, no foul.

As indicated in the beginning, the elevation gain on this trail is a mere 600 feet over 3.5 miles. You'll find yourself gradually ascending and descending into the punchbowl. Hiking on the south side of the mountains offers multiple benefits, such as shade from the sun and cooler temperatures in the canyon. While on the straight and narrow (literally) we noticed again the demonstration of Nature's contrasting views. Ahead of us we had a tree topped peak, and beside us we had a steep slide of earth to balance out the blues of the sky before we shifted towards a rockier landscape. Just taking the time to admire the rocks that Pollock the sides of the trail, while the trees intervene can be a humbling and quiet experience. Nevertheless, the trail awaits!

This trail has several false summits, where we found ourselves climbing rocks to check out what views the punchbowl had to offer. At approximately 3 miles into the hike, you will reach the point pictured below. The trail will steeply descend and you will notice the soil here is more silty and sandy compared to the compacted dirt we're all used to. You will need to return the way you came, so remember to save some energy for this heart-pumping half-mile.

The trail will begin to level and you will reach this clearing with signs for the Devil's Chair and South Fork. Head westbound for the chair, and the railing will be immediately visible.

The Punchbowl was created from the collision of two active earthquake faults, resulting in the 300 vertical foot rock formations we see today. Intense geological formations with slabs of stone and pine trees intermixed below clear blue skies. This is one hike you won't forget.

This fairly hidden gem in the northern part of the the San Gabriels is a "must-see" type of deal! The rock formations can been seen on the drive, and never fails to leave us in awe. It's quite interesting what active faulting and natural elements can create. The natural wear and tear of the earth beneath our feet leaves us with so many natural art installations, one of the more interesting ones being the breathtaking Devil's Punchbowl. The active faults of the San Andreas and the punchbowl, in combination with hundreds of years of wind and rain erosion from the towering mountains just south may sound like Nature's own violence against itself, but in actuality, it is the culmination of something grand, something unforgettably artistic.
