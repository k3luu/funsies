Vernal falls is a portion of the Mist Trail on the High Sierra Loop, and is considered a signature hike in Yosemite National Park. The hike up to the top of vernal falls is 3 miles round trip and is rated as a moderate. We got to the trail head by following the Happy Isle Trail out of Half Dome Village. The hike to the Sierra Loop Trailhead was about a mile down the Happy Isle trail that runs along the river. However, if you feel like conserving your energy you can take the shuttle from the village to stop 16 and take a short hike to the trailhead.

You can park just about anywhere in the eastern half of Yosemite Valley and catch a free shuttle bus to the trailhead near Happy Isle. The nearest parking, however, is at the trailhead parking lot, which is just east of Curry Village. If it's full, try Curry Village, where you can usually find a spot if you're willing to poke around in the back corners of the unpaved section of the lot. This is a very popular hike, so get here as early as 7AM.

There are two parts to this hike. The first portion of the hike is 0.8 miles long  on a fully paved path and this leads you to the Vernal Fall Bridge. This portion of the trail does have a loot of foot traffic mainly because it's the easiest part of the hike. During the right season this bridge holds you above a raging river of water pouring out into the valley.

The bridge is a great place to take a break and gather yourself before the the last mile stretch to the top of Vernal Falls. The hike to the top is even more steep and about halfway up the path turns into shifty granite stairs that are soaking wet from the waterfallâ€™s mist. There were many puddles on the ground, some too deep to step through without waterproof boots/shoes. If you are hiking at the end of spring towards the middle of summer you will definitely get soaked on this portion up. Once you get past the mist of the falls, the path turns into steeper makeshift rock steps. The footing here is a bit tough but the ground is dry here. The steps then lead to a one lane incline walkway. There is fencing and a rail to keep you from falling, but the walkway can get wet.

After that portion of the incline you are welcomed with an overwhelming view from the top. From here you can turn around and head back the way you came, or if you are prepared and up for the challenge, continue on to Nevada Falls for an additional 2 miles.
