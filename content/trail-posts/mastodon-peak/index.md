&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onto the hiking trails! Mastodon Peak via Cottonwood Campground follows a gravel trail and ends with a vast, scenic view of Joshua Tree National Park. Starting at Cottonwood Campground, follow signs for Mastodon Peak, Cottonwood Springs, and Cottonwood Oasis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these destinations split at the starting point, so it is up to you to decide where you want to go! With relatively no elevation gain, the hike is fairly easy. We visited during the Spring, where the weather was just right. Not too hot, not too cold. We mostly found ourselves climbing nearly every single rock formation, and sunbathing on massive boulders.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trail ends with your ascension up Mastodon Peak at 3,440 ft elevation. The hike up is a breeze, no climbing gear required. After taking in the breathtaking view, you return to camp the same way you come in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the sun goes down and all the noisy campers quiet down, the stars visibly come out and in more numbers than you've ever experienced. At the end of the day, it's the sea of stars and the ambiance of the campfire that made this trip memorable.
