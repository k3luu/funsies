The hike to Mount Disappointment and San Gabriel Peak did not meet our expectation, rather, the 360 panoramic views of all the peaks that make up the San Gabriel mountains was far from being a disappointment! This roughly 4 mile, moderately-trafficked, out and back trail takes you through the very heart of the San Gabriels, and provides the opportunity to hit multiple peaks on a single day hike. This is considered a moderate-level hike due to the short, but steep switchbacks and quick elevation gain as you summit each peak.

Route yourself to the Bill Reily Trailhead, which can be searched via Google Maps. After exiting the 210 N, head north on Angeles Crest Highway CA-39 for approximately 13 miles. Make a right onto Mount Wilson Red Box Road and there will be a small parking lot to your right in 0.4 miles. There is an upper parking level if you continue onto the service road.

The first thing we noticed is that the trail is not well-maintained, you might even miss it as you mistakenly start hiking on the paved road. Look south for a subtly defined trail that aggressively ascends into the dense shrubbery. Even in the second picture from the top above you can see gnarled bent trees that swallow the trail. Beautifully misleading. The trail has shown heavy signs of erosion - watch your footing!

As you make your way through the switchbacks, take notice of the type of vegetation in this particular area. The shrubs are familiar to all Angeleno hikers, but you won't be covered in any pine trees. The colors that sprout up from the dirt below foot form a polka dot print that really is something special if you take the time to admire. The first half mile on the Bill Reily Trailhead has a few openings that offer expansive views of Valley Forge to the east and Bear Canyon to the west. The trail is mostly shaded for the first mile until it intersects with Mt. Disappointment Road. Below is one spot in particular that we admired straight away. The mountains form a turtle shell like image that shoulders the sky. Truly, these mountains over take every other part of this view, and instead are merely accented by the trees in the foreground. A bright reminder to keep you grounded while you look out upon the vastness.

Did we mention how grand the views are between the shroud of shrubbery? Let it soak in.

The first mile of the hike is entirely shaded as you trek hidden in the leaves. Today was a particularly hot day, so the shade was our saving grace for our ascent to the first peak.

You can see gnarled and bent trees that swallow the trail. Beautifully misleading.

The mound to the southeast is San Gabriel Peak. It's a beautiful sight to behold, perfectly split between the dry south side and densely vegetated north side.

Jump back on the service road and stray right to head up to Mt. Disappointment, a flattened summit formerly intended as a Nike Missile Station back in 1955.

The trails will diverge, and if you take a look back, you'll see the next challenge that is San Gabriel Peak.

The station at Mt. Disappointment now serves as telecommunication for commercial and government agencies. Subjectively, we thought the views from Mt. Disappointment were better than San Gabriel peak, but we'll leave that up to you to decide. Don't forget to take in the amazing views of the City of Los Angeles, and then head back the same way you came.

Once you return to the junction on the service road, stray right towards the helipad. The trailhead to San Gabriel Peak will shortly be up ahead.

The trail to San Gabriel dips down for a few feet, but do not be fooled! The remainder of the hike will be another uphill battle - such is the life of "peak baggers." As the trail spirals to the top, take a breather and don't forget to admire the surrounding views. The organized chaos that lines the trail should provide you with more than enough entertainment while you slog uphill. From arthritic trees limbs that reach out, as if the shrubbery were aggressively bringing them closer to the soil, to the overwhelming patterns that hug you, there is something for everyone. Just make sure you take the time to look. There's a lot of beauty on this trail that might go overlooked, so it's fitting that the hike meets the namesake of the mountain.

Take a look back and you can see Mt. Disappointment from a distance. It's very easy to lose track of how far you've hiked.

Once you reach the top of San Gabriel Peak, grab a seat on the bench and sign-in! Take notice of the USGS plaque on the ground letting you know you've summited one of many peaks in the San Gabriels. Congrats on a job well done! If you're up for the challenge, there are several other peaks you can hit in the surrounding area, such as Mount Lowe, Mount Markham, and Mount Deception. According to the Hundred Peaks Section List of the Sierra Club (Angeles Chapter), Mt. Disappointment earned its name after USGS surveyors believed it to be the highest peak in the vicinity, only to find out that San Gabriel Peak located half a mile to the east was a few hundred feet higher. Reiterating what we said before, such is the life of bagging peaks. When you summit the highest peak on your personal record, there will always be a higher peak waiting for you.
