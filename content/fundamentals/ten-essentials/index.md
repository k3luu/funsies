Knowledge is the key to using the Ten Essentials. Having items in your pack has no value unless you understand how to use them.

It’s critical that you plan ahead, whether you go on day hike or a backpacking trip. Stay warm, hydrated, energized, and aware of your surroundings. You’ll never appreciate their true value until the situation arises where you really need one of them! The Great Outdoors has its obstacles and unforeseen conditions, whether you like it or not. Time and time again, they will become second nature to you. These are your Ten Essentials, your gear for life.
