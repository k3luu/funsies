Mission Peak overlooks the San Francisco Bay area and is enjoyed by hundreds of visitors each day. The Chaparral-filled trail boasts a 2,000 ft elevation gain over a short 3-mile distance, but the views on the way justify this grueling ascent. The trail is entirely exposed to the sun, so if you can’t wait for the colder seasons, it is best to start early in the morning or in the evening. Our goal was to hike in the late afternoon and catch the sunset by the time we reached the peak. Although rated as difficult, this is a manageable hike for beginners who are in fairly good shape. Take your time, bring plenty of water, and pace yourself as you make your way to the famous monument.

Route yourself to the Mission Peak parking lot located at 680 Standford Avenue, Fremont, California. At the end of the road, you will find a medium-sized parking lot. It seems this parking lot is full at any given time of the day, so finding parking is a hit or miss. If the lot is full, backtrack on Stanford Avenue and park along the residential street (Vineyard Avenue). Pay attention to street signage and parking restrictions, and **respect the local residents!**

Fill your bottle at the trailhead and head past the access gate. The trail will steadily ascend with grassland views as far east as the eye can see, and will broadly meander through the hills. We hiked this trail at the end of August, so the terrain felt more like a parched desert than the lush green hills you may find on social media. The trail will split within the first 100 meters but **stay left.**

The terrain is more or less like the photo shown below—a dirt and rock-ridden path that regular running shoes can handle but will test your stamina and endurance. Try to keep up a solid pace and let views of the bay motivate you when the trail starts to feel longer than it should.

You’ll most likely run into some form of wildlife. Herds of cows and their calves can be seen grazing the grasslands, and some even cross onto the trail itself. Other hikers have observed wild turkeys, squirrels, coyotes, jackrabbits, and tarantulas. Some may not consider cows as wildlife, but in any case, maintain your distance and do not approach or agitate them. If you have a dog with you, make sure to keep them tightly leashed. Visitors should also beware of rattlesnakes.

At the 2.5 mile mark, the trail will send you southbound as you make your way up the north ridge of the mountain.

The last half mile to the peak is a steep and rocky battle. The terrain becomes more technical, so proceed carefully.

Unfortunately, our timing was a bit off and the sun had already set by the time we reached the peak. But the sunset-colored gradients, mountain breeze, and the aforementioned views were enough for us to pause for careful observation. At the top, you will find the famous monument. A 6-foot pole with steel tubes pointing in multiple directions. If you look through the various tubes, you can see other prominent peaks throughout the Bay Area. Take your triumphant photo next to the pole, and peek into your next challenge.

According to <a href="https://www.ebparks.org/parks/mission/default.htm" target="_blank">East Bay Parks</a>, the monument was erected by park ranger Leonard Page and serves to promote environmental awareness. As we peered through each tube of the monument, we were bombarded with the beautiful peaks of the Bay Area. At that moment, the monument resonated with us and our goal as Two Half-Hitches—to provide guidance for those looking to engage with nature through the various trails of California and beyond. Cheers.
