Ice House Canyon begins a half-mile from the entrance to Mt. Baldy, and is one of the more lush trails running parallel to Ice House Creek. If you want to save minutes hunting for parking, get there earlier in the day to bypass the late morning rush. Hiking permits are required in the Cucamonga Wilderness, and can be picked up at the Visitor Center or at the trail head.

The hike to Chapman trail is a mile from the parking lot, and is entirely shaded by the canyon. The first half is more of a scenic stroll geared towards those who want to escape the city, or those who want to immerse themselves in lush forestry. The creek flows steadily year-round, and appears to be unaffected by the past year's drought.

Once you hit the Chapman trail marker, the elevation gain begins. Despite the lack of switchbacks, it's still a challenging portion of the trail. However, it is only a small stretch of the hike at a mere 1.5 miles. With less trees to shade you, be prepared for the midday heat. Pack some water and wear a hat, and you should be good to go. It's also important that you pace yourself in the heat.

On your way to the top, be sure to take a moment and glance at the clearing. The contrasting view of the San Gabriel Mountains and the city is truly a sight to behold, but is easy to miss if you're always looking down at your boots. There's always time to admire your boots, so do yourself a favor and pick your head up once in a while and see what you're missing.

So when you're thinking to yourself, _seriously, are we not there yet? How have we not walked a mile and a half?_, we promise that what's coming up is worth it.

Cedar Glen Campground is very spacious and accommodating. Campfires are not permitted, but stoves are allowed with a fire permit. It took us about 2 hours to reach the campgrounds, and had a lot of time to spare. We set up camp, took off our boots, and took a nap. Fortunately, we woke up at golden hour and were greeted by orange-highlighted mountain ridges. If you're lucky, you'll get the view that we had of trees speckling the mountain side playing a vigorous game of connect the dots with the sunlight.

I think we can all agree that smog is a heavy blanket on our major cities; however, you have to give it up to smog for the pink afterglow of the setting sun. With all this in mind, just know that the effort and sweat are going to pay off several different times and give you mental photographs that will encourage you to get up and do it all over again.
