&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Located in Orange County, Crystal Cove State Park encompasses 2,400 acres of backcountry wilderness, 3 miles of beachfront, and boasts 18 miles of hiking trails. Surrounded by coastal sage scrub, ocean views, and the sea breeze, this is one refreshing hike you'll likely come back to time and time again. This park offers amazing coastal hiking and trail variations, so you get to decide the difficulty of your adventure. From easy out and back trails to moderate/strenuous loop trails, there's something here for everyone.

There are many parking options for Crystal Cove. You can choose to park at the El Moro Visitor Center for $15 (All Day), which offers beach access. There are also four entrances: two along the bluffs at Pelican Point and Reef Point, and two inland at Los Trancos and School/State Park. We decided to park near Coastal Peak Park, which offers free public parking, at least to the extent of our knowledge.

We decided to enter through Ridge Park onto the No Name Ridge Trail, which takes you all the way down to the Beach. This trail takes you along the west perimeter of Crystal Cove. Check out the map below for other trail recommendations provided by Crystal Cove State Park! Whichever route you take, please respect the land and only use designated trails.

Make your way past the Ridge Park entrance onto the dirt paved trail. Not only is this area highly trafficked with other hikers, but also bikers. Make sure to watch out for them. We hiked relativity early in the morning and found a fading marine layer residing in the canyon.

Above you'll see one of the many sweeping views that this trail has to offer. Intrusive green springs up in the form of shrubbery to create a great contrasting view of the earth and the hazy sky above.With that being said, there is absolutely no shade on this trail, but fortunately, it was much cooler the day we went. On any other given day, make sure to bring enough water, sunscreen, and a hat.

Plant life sprouts out of rock faces quite frequently on this trail, which resembles something like a splinter that has nestled its way into your thumb. After 1.3 miles, you will come across a gate where the unnamed trail will join with No Name Ridge. Continue heading in the southwest direction, and eventually you will hit a glimpse of the vast ocean. More often than not, nature finds ways to surprise us. Below showcases just one of the beautiful features that this trail has to offer. Getting this glimpse of vastness as we rounded the corner was all too humbling, and is just one way in which we find ourselves constantly surprised.

Once you reach the bottom of the No Name Ridge trail, you will pass another gate onto a parking lot. You will come across a ranger station and other hikers about to trek in the direction you came from.

Continue down south on the paved road and look for signs indicating beach access. You will eventually reach a tunnel, and that light at the end of the tunnel will be the sandy shores.

Take sometime to enjoy the beach, dig your toes into the sand, and enjoy the tranquility of the ocean waves. We're not fans of the beach, but hey, we can come to appreciate it every once in a while. Sometimes just standing in the presence of such a beauty is enough to ground you in the experience. This is one of those times.

In addition to hiking, Crystal Cove offers three campgrounds, one in a canyon and two at the higher elevations. The higher trails offer beautiful vistas of the mountainous backcountry, geological formations, and the blue Pacific Ocean.  Exploring the lower trails offers hiking through riparian woo dlands with oak and sycamore trees along the seasonal Moro Creek.
