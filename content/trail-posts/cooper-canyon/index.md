Cooper Canyon Trail Camp via Burkhart Trail is a beautiful, light hike that takes you through the San Gabriel high country. Your hike begins at Buckhorn Campground on the Burkhart Trail for about 2.75 miles to your destination, located right off the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).

The trail is in great condition with a few notables that make this a great experience for an overnighter and especially, for first-time backpackers. The trail and campground is water accessible with seasonal streams (not potable, please treat before consuming). There's sage scrub, chaparral, and conifer trees as far as the eye I can see, several creeks to traverse, and a few wooden logs to climb. The elevation gain is steady, and quite moderate.

The campground sits at approximately 6,300 ft elevation with 6 hike-in campsites. Sites are on a first-come, first-serve basis with no permit required (aside from the Adventure Pass for parking). There are designated campfire pits, tables, makeshift benches, and one restroom. In addition to camping, the trail also takes you to Cooper Canyon Falls, a small, delicate waterfall with a shallow bottom, perfect for relaxing or a pit stop for some lunch.

Although best for 3-season hiking, we decided to go in the Winter. Temperatures dropped below freezing at about 24 degrees Fahrenheit, and all the water in our Nalgene's froze over (But that didn't stop us). With that said, it is very important to know the conditions of the hike you are planning on undertaking, and being equipped with proper gear. Our trip lasted 3 days and 2 nights. Most of the time we found ourselves huddled around the campfire, if not trying to sit in it.

The next morning, we disassembled our tents, packed our gear, and returned to the trailhead the same way we came in. Although the sheer cold was a challenging element, the trip was very enjoyable. We highly recommend this trail for those looking for a calm and easy hike through the graceful woods of the Angeles National Forest. Just not in the winter season.
