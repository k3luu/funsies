Cooper Canyon Falls is beautifully hidden in the San Gabriel mountains, just a short distance from Buckhorn Campground on the Burkhart Trail. This 3 mile, out and back, moderately trafficked hike takes you through the more dense regions of the Angeles National Forest. The route to the trailhead requires a bit more driving on the Angeles Crest Highway, but the change in terrain and scenery makes up for the windy road. This 40-ft waterfall flows seasonally, and is best to visit during the Spring. You can make an overnighter out of this by staying at <a href="/cooper-canyon-trail-camp-via-burkhart-trail">Cooper Canyon Trail Camp</a>.

Route yourself to Buckhorn Campground, approximately 36 miles northeast on the Angeles Crest Highway from La Canada Flintridge. Do not turn into the Buckhorn Day Use Picnic Area, instead, continue a couple feet until you see a sign for the Buckhorn Campground Entrance. Continue past the campsites and look out for the Day Use Parking Area at the very end. Display an Adventure Pass and hit the trail!

The hike to the falls follows a well-maintained dirt trail surrounded by dense vegetation, Redwood-like trees, and interesting rock formations (some you can easily climb). You’ll find yourself under a shady grove of trees in some areas and then find yourself peaking out onto rocky traverses. The dramatic shifts in scenery serve as welcoming distractions throughout the hike. One moment you’ll hear the abrasive crunch of pebbles beneath your feet, and then the next moment you’ll be hearing the squish of mud under toe. Along with these auditory cues come the contrasting visuals of greenery overtaking the more typical Angeles Forest color pallet (as seen below).

The next two photos are a solid representation of the different types of terrain you’ll be experiencing while out on the trail. At times you’ll be surrounded on all sides, and others will see you hugging the wall of a mountain beside you while the sun drenches you in it’s light. Even though hiking in the mid-August sun isn’t our first choice, we were greeted by a sweeping view of the canyon and all it had to offer before us when we rounded every turn into that specific light.

The first 1.5 miles is a fairly easy stretch, mostly downhill in some areas, and simple to navigate. You will descend more than 600 feet over the span of the first mile. The hike back to the parking lot will follow a gradual ascent, but nothing to worry about. As you descend into the canyon, you’ll need to cross a few streams. 

During your descent you’ll switch between the encompassing sunlight, and the shadow of the countless trees surrounding the trail. Aside from their shade, the green tipped giants offer a noteworthy shakeup in the color scheme of the canyon. The pale rock becomes even more pronounced in denser areas of vegetation. The aforementioned streams also diversify the trail and provide a great opportunity to take a breather while sitting streamside. While the stream was running low during our mid August excursion, the third image posted below is a great representation of the serenity you might feel just listening to the sounds of the water, and fish that swim the stream.

Once you reach the sign shown below for the Cooper Canyon Trail, continue heading north on the Burkhart Trail. Cooper Canyon Trail will take you to the take trail camp, which is haven for thru-hikers braving the PCT.

Above you’ll see one of our favorite shots from the trip. The diverse nature of the trail is captured in this one photo. Whether it’s the color of the trees, or the shifting sunlight, you can always find something new to be awestruck by on the trail. Seeing things from a multiplicity of angles and lenses allows us to see more of what nature has to offer, and this trail showcased that concept beautifully. 

Hike a few yards on the Burkhart Trail and pay attention to the subtle signs that will point you towards the falls. Cooper Canyon Falls is located off of the trail. During our visit, a bush was marked with the orange tape we commonly see and there was even a pile of rocks (known as a “cairn”) to guide us.

The path to the falls will descend dramatically. A previous hiker decided to leave a rope to help visitors repel down. It might not be necessary for some, maybe if you have children in your group, but it’s definitely fun to use!

The great part of this trail is the the reward for such a short and simple hike. Unfortunately, we visited during the tail end of summer, so there was not much flow coming down from the falls. There were a few streams you can see and a healthy coat of moss. Visit during the spring season for a more beautiful cascade of water. In its peak, the water level of the pool below can be much higher to the point where you can bathe in it. For us, a quick nap on the boulder was fulfilling enough, and the trail itself provided ample “wow” moments to where we weren’t disappointed that our destination wasn’t the most inspiring production.
