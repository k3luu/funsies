&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting up a tent is straight forward, but it can be difficult and confusing your first time around. Before you head out, we recommend practicing at home!

###Picking the Ideal Location

- Find a relatively flat surface, if at all possible. If you're on a hillside, situate yourself such that your head is up uphill.
- Remove any rocks, debris, or any sharp objects that may harm you or damage your tent.
- Avoid low points, sumps, or ditches. If it rains, your tent will literally become a pool.
- Try to place your tent near a stable windwall (e.g. boulders, tree trunks, fallen logs, etc.)
- On hot and sunny days, situate your tent underneath trees. Be cautious about falling objects (e.g. heavy snow loads, pine cones, etc.).
- Keep your tent at a safe distance from campfires, as all tents are extremely flammable.
- Keep your tent away from dining/food areas, in case of wildlife.
- Avoid setting up your tent near standing water, where mosquitoes are likely to breed.
- Maintain a safe distance from water sources as flash floods may occur.
- Stake your tent on silty-loamy soils.
