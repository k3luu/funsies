Echo Mountain is a 5.5 mile out and back, heavily-trafficked trail, rich in history and scenic canyons. Located in the San Gabriel Mountains just north of the City of Altadena, this hike provides the opportunity to explore what was once a mountain railway as you make your way to the ruins of a mountaintop resort.

The trail head begins at the Cobb Estate located at the intersection of East Loma Alta Drive and Lake Avenue. You may find a swarm of hikers at the entrance - this is your cue to find parking. Note, this is a residential area. An Adventure Pass is not applicable, so be sure to check the street signs for parking. We recommend arriving as early as 6 or 7 in the morning, no later than 8 AM.

Walk through the Cobb Estate gates and head down the asphalt road for a couple yards. Bear right onto the dirt path and look for the Altadena Crest Trail. The Cobb Estate was known for having several gold mines and water wells within the property boundaries back in 1959. The land was later donated to the U.S. Forest Service and turned into the trail we see today.

The views are astounding and the trail is well maintained. The elevation gain is steady and moderate as you switch back up the mountain. You will find yourself catching the same views overlooking the city, and then a quick 180 back to mountains. Getting out here early has its perks. While a view of the city may not be dauntingly gorgeous to LA natives, the early morning sun crests the mountains in a golden rim that gave us pause. Along the way you'll be treated to different types of vegetation, which helps keep your eyes off your feet and aid in the passing of time. Below you'll see what we mean by different types of vegetation. The dynamic range that the Santa Ana's have are able to transport you far outside the city, and far outside all of the noise. Variety and history are this trail's strongest attributes, as it causes you to feel like every turn is another destination, and another goal that has been met.

Depending on the season, hiking this trail will make you break a sweat. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen, and a hat to keep you cool. The trail has several shaded areas here and there. If you hike in the morning, the top side of the mountain may provide additional shade. If you head out early you'll get a head start on the heat, but we still can't stress enough how important it is to be prepared for the heat that will surely make an appearance.

At about a 1.5 miles, you can begin to see how the trail clashes with the city. While the city imposes on your views now and again, it becomes more of a blur as you get farther up the trail. As you progress you might start to inadvertently fade the city out of your view, or maybe that's just the heat doing its work.

There's not much left of the railway, but you can still see some remains of the iron track. You almost don't notice it if you're not focusing on your surroundings. Not only does this trail have some killer views, but its ties to history make it all the more worth the work. Just wait until you get to the top.

If you're looking for more of a challenge, turn left and head on up to Inspiration Point.

After about 3 miles, you'll hit a small plaque indicating you've reached the Mount Lowe Railway. Continue walking until you hit the Echo Mountain Picnic Area. Take a break, munch on some snacks, or make your way to your final destination. The Historical Society has blessed us with the opportunity to check out the old gears of the railway. While some old gears may not seem impressive, it's more about what the gears represent that leave a lasting impression. Much like holding an old book, or family photo, there's history here. We tried to imagine what it was like to be one of the first people to ride this railway to the top, and what their faces must have been like as they looked over everything the area had to offer. The fact that we're treated to the trail, as well as these historical artifacts is a unique and enriching experience. Take a minute and let that resonate if you're as into history as we are.

Echo mountain protrudes below the peak of inspiration point, and is considered a short extension of the mountain. The name originates from the echoes one could emit into the canyon using the "echophones" were built during the time of the Mount Lowe Railway. Just another fun bit of information for you!

The Mount Lowe Railway monument area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Forest Service, and is the manifestation of two aspiring individuals. In 1891, Thaddeus S. C. Lowe collaborated with David Joseph Macpherson to construct a network of trails and railways in the San Gabriel Mountains. Thaddeus Lowe, better known as Professor T. S. C. Lowe, was an American Civil War scientist and inventor, and revered as pioneer in military aerial reconnaissance in the United States. David Macpherson was a civil engineer graduate from Cornell University and was recognized for his work on railroads as a city planner. For some time, he spent his days wandering the hills above Altadena with the idea of developing a railroad in the San Gabriels, from the bottom of Rubio Canyon to the peak of Echo Mountain. These two aspiring men formed the Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad Company and constructed the electric-powered Mount Lowe Railway. In addition to the railway, Lowe also developed the resort (pictured below), known as "White City," which attracted millions of people to its doorstep. In 1899, the railway was bought by Jared S. Torrance, a real estate developer and the founder of the City of Torrance in Los Angeles County. The last train ride ended in 1937 and by the 1960s, the entire system was dismantled. The mountaintop resort was lost to wildfires and winds; however, the plaques and photos that remain allow our imagination to run.

While this post may have been heavy on the history, we thought it was important to give the history of the trail just as much credit as the beauty of it all. More importantly, this hike comes at a time in the team's lives where we are all figuring out the next step. Seeing the fruits of two men's labor caused us all to take a step back and look at what we were all doing in our respective lives and really be real with our goals as a team and as individuals. As we always hammer in towards the end of our posts, going on these little excursions is always refreshing, but for us, we find much more in nature when we experience it with those we are closest to. So whatever your goals, dreams, or aspirations may be, try to get out there and be real about all of the things you want to accomplish, and share those ideas with someone you can count on. You don't have to build a railway. You don't have to build a mountain top hotel. Just do something, and be proud of your efforts no matter the outcome.
