          Life throws so many obstacles at us every day, creating a harsh ascent, similar to climbing a mountain. How we
          overcome these "mountains" is what makes us who we are.

          Growth does not exist without stepping outside your comfort zone. I picked up snowboarding a few seasons ago.
          Somewhat similar to other challenges I have dealt with in life, I just had to get back up after falling and
          keep at it. I push myself to ride different terrain, try things that I know would make me fall, and ride with
          others better than myself. Self-doubt is not a product of physical inability, but mental inability. Fear and
          doubt limits and originates in the mind. I never compare myself to others nor do I strive for perfection,
          rather, my goal is to be better than the last time I road. Stay motivated, optimistic, and true to yourself.
          Create the grandest and highest vision for yourself because you are what you believe.

          FAILURE. I don't have any natural born talents or physical gifts. I've been an underdog my whole life (I'd
          argue that I still am), but I've been able to get up and over the top through plenty of trial and error. It's
          through those times that I was able to learn and grow. By failing over and over and over again, I'm able to
          succeed through and with experience. You can't have failure without success. You can't have success without
          failure.

          I relate my life to my passion for fitness. In many ways they are similar to that moment you open the gym
          door. You are suited and ready to take on a task that seems impossible to others, a lift that seems immovable.
          The odds are stacked against you. However, it is in your mindset that the real battle happens. Itâ€™s you who
          decides whether you accept defeat or overcome that fear and climb that mountain. It is in each and everyone of
          us built, our DNA, to adapt and overcome our obstacles. We will face challenges everyday but know you have it
          in you to make a change and climb.

        <h5>Transportation technology Engineer | Climber</h5>

          I learned from climbing that power can emerge from perseverance, planning, and practice. I learned to not fear
          failure. I learned that confidence in myself can allow me to do things I never imagined possible. I can
          conquer mountains if I know I can.

        <h3>Scottie Nguyen</h3>
        <h5>Salt & Fresh Water Fisherman</h5>
        <p>
          Make every decision, a conscious decision. From the culture of Fishing I've learned the importance of
          preparation, adaptation, and having a commitment to persevere. Every trip offshore is a new mountain with new
          conditions. Often times we only have short windows to produce. Hours of preparation for 15 minutes of
          opportunity. In these short windows my every decision makes the difference. I don't always bring a catch home,
          but I never come home empty handed. Learning what worked, and what didn't, to change my decisions at the next
          opportunity. In life, you can't move the mountain or control its rock slides, but you choose your path to
          conquering it.
